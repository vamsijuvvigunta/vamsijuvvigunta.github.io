Tokens have opened a new frontier,&#8221; Huang told the audience. He emphasized that tokens can &#8220;transform images into scientific data charting alien atmospheres,&#8221; &#8220;decode the laws of physics,&#8221; and &#8220;see disease before it takes hold.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This vision represents a shift from traditional &#8220;retrieval computing&#8221; to &#8220;generative computing,&#8221; where AI understands context and generates answers rather than just fetching pre-stored data. According to Huang, this transition necessitates a new kind of data center architecture where &#8220;the computer has become a generator of tokens, not a retrieval of files.&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/beyond-retrieval-nvidia-charts-course-for-the-generative-computing-era/\"><img alt=\"YouTube Video\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F_waPvOwL9Z8%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" /></a><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Blackwell Architecture Delivers Massive Performance Gains</h2>\n<p>The NVIDIA Blackwell GPU architecture, now in &#8220;full production,&#8221; delivers what the company claims is &#8220;40x the performance of Hopper&#8221; for reasoning models under identical power conditions. The architecture includes support for FP4 precision, leading to significant energy efficiency improvements.</p>\n<p>&#8220;ISO power, Blackwell is 25 times,&#8221; Huang stated, highlighting the dramatic efficiency gains of the new platform.</p>\n<p>The Blackwell architecture also supports extreme scale-up through technologies like NVLink 72, enabling the creation of massive, unified GPU systems. Huang predicted that Blackwell's performance will make previous generation GPUs significantly less desirable for demanding AI workloads.</p>\n<p><!-- notionvc: 0bac78a7-eef5-4995-9324-7ac3b39fda9a --></p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_214120\" style=\"width: 1126px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-214120 size-full\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gtc25-blog-blackwell-ultra_9160-1600x900-1-1536x864-1.jpg\" width=\"1116\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-214120\">(Source: NVIDIA)</p></div>\n<p><!-- notionvc: e0b09199-a1ce-4982-b123-82fdc5aa0b39 --></p>\n<h2>Predictable Roadmap for AI Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>NVIDIA outlined a regular annual cadence for its AI infrastructure innovations, allowing customers to plan their investments with greater certainty:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blackwell Ultra (Second half of 2025):</strong> An upgrade to the Blackwell platform with increased FLOPs, memory, and bandwidth.</li>\n<li><strong>Vera Rubin (Second half of 2026):</strong> A new architecture featuring a CPU with doubled performance, a new GPU, and next-generation NVLink and memory technologies.</li>\n<li><strong>Rubin Ultra (Second half of 2027):</strong> An extreme scale-up architecture aiming for 15 exaflops of compute per rack.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Democratizing AI: From Networking to Models</h2>\n<p>To realize the vision of widespread AI adoption, NVIDIA announced comprehensive solutions spanning networking, hardware, and software. At the infrastructure level, the company is addressing the challenge of connecting hundreds of thousands or even millions of GPUs in AI factories through significant investments in silicon photonics technology. Their first co-packaged optics (CPO) silicon photonic system, a 1.6 terabit per second CPO based on micro ring resonator modulator (MRM) technology, promises substantial power savings and increased density compared to traditional transceivers, enabling more efficient connections between massive numbers of GPUs across different sites.</p>\n<p>While building the foundation for large-scale AI factories, NVIDIA is simultaneously bringing AI computing power to individuals and smaller teams. The company introduced a new line of <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/\">DGX personal AI supercomputers powered by the Grace Blackwell platform</a>, aimed at empowering AI developers, researchers, and data scientists. The lineup includes DGX Spark, a compact development platform, and DGX Station, a high-performance desktop workstation with liquid cooling and an impressive 20 petaflops of compute.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_214121\" style=\"width: 1127px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-214121 size-full\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-1.jpg\" width=\"1117\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-214121\">NVIDIA DGX Spark (Source: NVIDIA)</p></div>\n<p><!-- notionvc: e3d044da-7b6f-4c18-be3e-a3f37379129a --></p>\n<p>Complementing these hardware advancements, NVIDIA announced the open <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/build-enterprise-ai-agents-with-advanced-open-nvidia-llama-nemotron-reasoning-models/\">Llama Nemotron family of models</a> with reasoning capabilities, designed to be enterprise-ready for building advanced <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/why-ai-agents-are-the-future-of-work/\">AI agents</a>. These models are integrated into NVIDIA NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices), allowing developers to deploy them across various platforms from local workstations to the cloud. The approach represents a full-stack solution for enterprise AI adoption.</p>\n<p>Huang emphasized that these initiatives are being enhanced through extensive collaborations with major companies across multiple industries who are integrating NVIDIA models, NIM, and libraries into their AI strategies. This ecosystem approach aims to accelerate adoption while providing flexibility for different enterprise needs and use cases.</p>\n<h2>Physical AI and Robotics: A $50 Trillion Opportunity</h2>\n<p>NVIDIA sees physical AI and robotics as a &#8220;$50 trillion opportunity,&#8221; according to Huang. The company announced the open-source NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1, described as a &#8220;generalist foundation model for humanoid robots.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Significant updates to the NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models provide unprecedented control over synthetic data generation for robot training using NVIDIA Omniverse. As Huang explained, &#8220;Using Omniverse to condition Cosmos, and Cosmos to generate an infinite number of environments, allows us to create data that is grounded, controlled by us and yet systematically infinite at the same time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The company also unveiled a new open-source physics engine called &#8220;Newton,&#8221; developed in collaboration with Google DeepMind and Disney Research. The engine is designed for high-fidelity robotics simulation, including rigid and soft bodies, tactile feedback, and GPU acceleration.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_214122\" style=\"width: 1126px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-214122 size-full\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Adobe-Express-file-1-1.jpg\" width=\"1116\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-214122\">Isaac GR00T N1 (Source: NVIDIA)</p></div>\n<p><!-- notionvc: aeef8284-6f7d-4c58-83e7-19c66abdb61c --></p>\n<h2>Agentic AI and Industry Transformation</h2>\n<p>Huang defined &#8220;agentic AI&#8221; as AI with &#8220;agency&#8221; that can &#8220;perceive and understand the context,&#8221; &#8220;reason,&#8221; and &#8220;plan and take action,&#8221; even using tools and learning from multimodal information.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Agentic AI basically means that you have an AI that has agency. It can perceive and understand the context of the circumstance. It can reason, very importantly can reason about how to answer or how to solve a problem, and it can plan and action. It can plan and take action. It can use tools,&#8221; Huang explained.</p>\n<p>This capability is driving a surge in computational demands: &#8220;The amount of computation requirement, the scaling law of AI is more resilient and in fact hyper accelerated. The amount of computation we need at this point as a result of agentic AI, as a result of reasoning, is easily a hundred times more than we thought we needed this time last year,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>Jensen Huang's GTC 2025 keynote presented a comprehensive vision of an AI-driven future characterized by intelligent agents, autonomous robots, and purpose-built AI factories. NVIDIA's announcements across hardware architecture, networking, software, and open-source models signal the company's determination to power and accelerate the next era of computing.</p>\n<p>As computing continues its shift from retrieval-based to generative models, NVIDIA's focus on tokens as the core currency of AI and on scaling capabilities across cloud, enterprise, and robotics platforms provides a roadmap for the future of technology, with far-reaching implications for industries worldwide.</p>\n<p><!-- notionvc: 6ae84ba4-8446-4984-a83c-da55f9abed60 --></p>\n<p><!-- notionvc: df2b54d9-9a28-495c-bd81-1dafdf9901c7 --></p>\n<p><!-- notionvc: 892f1424-4fda-4c62-b1d7-9c89467718a8 --></p>\n<p><!-- notionvc: e1f7851c-f47c-4d4a-ae52-1face1175049 --></p>\n<p><!-- notionvc: f3a0dac6-be76-4ec1-ad1b-3fa280d6b0c1 --></p>\n<div class=\"gsp_post_data\"></div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/beyond-retrieval-nvidia-charts-course-for-the-generative-computing-era/\">Beyond Retrieval: NVIDIA Charts Course for the Generative Computing Era</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai\">Unite.AI</a>.</p>"

At Merck Healthcare, I served as the inaugural Global Head of Data Science & AI, where I led the development of AI-driven solutions in healthcare and biotechnology. This role underscored the transformative potential of AI in health sectors.</p>\n<p>Transitioning to HealthAI allowed me to focus more intensively on responsible AI deployment in health, aiming to bridge the gap between technological innovation and human-centered care. In this, data governance is also one of my core focus points. Something that really excites me at HealthAI is the work we do in the context of regulatory and innovation sandboxes, we\u2019re building blueprints to accelerate the development and adoption of responsible AI at scale to enable innovators.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m driven by the question: <em>How can we make AI not just smarter, but truly useful where it matters most\u2014improving people\u2019s lives?</em> At HealthAI, I have the opportunity to shape how we think about AI in health, offering guidance to governments and health institutions on deploying AI solutions that are not only cutting-edge but also ethical, transparent, and deeply embedded in real-world health needs. For me, it\u2019s not just about algorithms\u2014it\u2019s about impact.</p>\n<p><strong>What excites you most about the intersection of AI and health?</strong></p>\n<p>The convergence of AI and health presents opportunities to enhance outcomes through improved diagnostics, personalized treatments, and optimized health solutions. AI's ability to analyze complex datasets can, for example, lead to earlier disease detection and more accurate prognoses.</p>\n<p>What excites me most is that these advancements are not just reserved for high-income countries\u2014they have the potential to transform health sectors in low- and middle-income countries as well. AI-powered diagnostics can bring specialist-level insights to regions with limited medical expertise, predictive analytics can help allocate resources where they are needed most, and digital health tools can bridge gaps in access to care. By deploying AI responsibly, we can create more equitable health solutions that serve people everywhere, regardless of geography or income level.</p>\n<p><strong>How can AI help close the health gap between high-income and low- and middle-income countries? What challenges exist in ensuring equitable access?</strong></p>\n<p>AI has the potential to democratize health by making advanced medical insights accessible globally. In regions with limited medical expertise, AI-powered diagnostic tools can assist in identifying diseases accurately. For example, telemedicine platforms, enhanced by AI, can connect patients in remote areas with specialists worldwide, facilitating knowledge transfer and improving care quality.</p>\n<p>Ensuring equitable access to AI-driven health solutions involves addressing several challenges, some of the most prominent ones relate to infrastructure limitations. This can hinder the adoption of AI technologies, as many regions may lack the necessary digital frameworks to support advanced solutions.</p>\n<p>Data privacy concerns also remain critical\u2014protecting personal information requires robust governance structures to ensure confidentiality and security. Additionally, AI systems must be tailored to local languages and cultural contexts to be truly effective, overcoming barriers that could otherwise limit accessibility.</p>\n<p>Regulatory hurdles further complicate the landscape, as striking the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring privacy plus safety requires thoughtful policy development. By addressing these challenges proactively, AI can become a powerful tool for improving global health equity.</p>\n<p><strong>How crucial are collaborations between governments, tech companies, and health providers in ensuring responsible AI development and deployment?</strong></p>\n<p>Collaboration among governments, technology firms, and healthcare providers is not just beneficial\u2014it\u2019s essential for the responsible development and deployment of AI in health. These partnerships enable the creation of comprehensive frameworks that address ethical considerations, safeguard data privacy, and establish operational standards that ensure AI is both effective and trustworthy.</p>\n<p>By working together, stakeholders can move beyond fragmented, one-size-fits-all solutions and instead develop AI-driven approaches that are tailored to real-world health needs. This means leveraging AI to enhance diagnostics, streamline clinical workflows, and expand access to quality care\u2014particularly in underserved regions. Moreover, collaboration fosters transparency and accountability, ensuring that AI remains a tool for empowerment rather than exclusion.</p>\n<p>When innovation is driven by shared responsibility and aligned with public health priorities, AI has the potential to reshape our approach to health in a way that is both transformative and equitable.</p>\n<p><strong>What ethical considerations should be at the forefront of AI-driven health solutions?</strong></p>\n<p>When we think about the ethical considerations in AI-driven health solutions, there are a few key areas we need to focus on. First, we have to address bias mitigation to ensure AI models don\u2019t unintentionally reinforce existing health disparities. Transparency is also crucial, as the decision-making process behind AI must be clear and understandable to all parties involved. Accountability comes next, with clear lines of responsibility for any decisions made by AI systems, so that someone can be held accountable if things go wrong.</p>\n<p>Autonomy is at the very core of ethical AI in health, which means it\u2019s essential that we not only respect but actively support people\u2019s rights to make well-informed decisions about their care. This goes beyond simply providing information\u2014it\u2019s about ensuring that people fully understand their options, the potential risks and benefits, and the role AI plays where it is employed.</p>\n<p>We must guarantee that the users or those who benefit from AI feel empowered and confident in their choices made, knowing they have a say in the technologies that affect their health and well-being.</p>\n<p><strong>AI models in health have sometimes demonstrated biases. How can regulators and AI developers mitigate this risk?</strong></p>\n<p>To mitigate biases in AI models, it is necessary that regulators and developers focus on building systems that are representative of diverse populations. This starts with collecting data from a wide range of demographic groups, so the AI is trained on information that reflects the real-world diversity of patients. But data alone isn\u2019t enough\u2014continuous monitoring is also key, as AI systems should be regularly assessed to identify and correct any biased patterns that may emerge over time.</p>\n<p>Involving a variety of stakeholders in the development process, including ethicists, patient representatives, clinicians, medical experts, etc., can bring in valuable perspectives that help ensure the AI models serve everyone equitably and fairly.</p>\n<p><strong>How can governments and organizations ensure that AI-driven health solutions responsibly use patient data?</strong></p>\n<p>To ensure that AI-driven health solutions responsibly use patient data, governments and organizations need to implement strong data governance policies that clearly outline how patient information is collected, stored, and shared.</p>\n<p>Anonymization techniques also play a core role in protecting people\u2019s identities, ensuring that data can be used without compromising privacy. On top of that, adhering to both international and local data protection laws is essential not only for maintaining trust but also for ensuring that AI systems are operating within legal boundaries. This approach helps create a foundation of security and transparency that benefits both people and the health sector as a whole.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the biggest obstacles in regulating AI for health, and how can countries overcome them?</strong></p>\n<p>The rapid pace at which technology advances comes to mind first. Regulations often struggle to keep up with how quickly AI innovations are emerging, leaving gaps in oversight. Additionally, policymakers need a deeper understanding of both AI technologies and the unique complexities of health to craft effective, informed regulations.</p>\n<p>Another hurdle is the lack of global standardization\u2014without consistent regulations across countries, it becomes difficult to foster international collaboration and ensure that AI solutions can be safely and ethically deployed worldwide.</p>\n<p>To overcome these obstacles, countries will need to invest in continuous education for policymakers, work towards harmonizing regulations internationally, and stay agile in adapting to new technological developments.</p>\n<p>Countries can address these obstacles by fostering continuous dialogue between technologists, health professionals, and regulators, and by investing in education and training programs that bridge knowledge gaps. HealthAI, for example, is tackling this through its Global Regulatory Network (GRN), which strengthens local capacity and capabilities in AI regulation for health, ensuring that regulators worldwide are well-equipped to manage the evolving landscape of AI in health.</p>\n<p><strong>How does HealthAI help countries build and certify responsible AI validation mechanisms?</strong></p>\n<p>As an implementation partner, HealthAI works together with governments, ministries of health, and other health organisations to navigate not only the safety and efficacy of AI-driven health tools but also their ethical compliance, ensuring that the technology aligns with both regulatory requirements and societal values.</p>\n<p>HealthAI supports the development of rigorous certification processes that help establish trust and accountability in AI health solutions. By doing so, we ensures that AI systems meet the highest standards before being deployed, which is essential for protecting welfare, enhancing beneficial outcomes, and fostering global confidence in the responsible use of AI in health.</p>\n<p><strong>How can AI be used to predict, track, and manage future health crises?</strong></p>\n<p>AI can play a pivotal role in managing health crises by providing tools to predict, track, and manage outbreaks more effectively. Through predictive analytics, AI can analyze vast amounts of epidemiological data, identifying patterns and trends that could signal the potential for an outbreak before it happens, giving authorities time to prepare. In addition, real-time surveillance powered by AI can continuously monitor health data from hospitals, clinics, and other sources, allowing for the rapid detection of emerging threats and the ability to respond quickly to contain them.</p>\n<p>AI can also assist in resource optimization during a crisis, helping authorities allocate medical supplies, personnel, and other critical resources more efficiently, ensuring that they are used where they are most needed. By integrating AI into public health strategies, countries can improve their ability to anticipate and respond to future health emergencies, enhancing both preparedness and resilience in the face of evolving threats. This proactive approach saves lives and helps to minimize the overall impact of health crises on society and the economy.</p>\n<p><em>Thank you for the great interview, readers who wish to learn more should visit <a href=\"https://www.healthai.agency/\">HealthAI</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/dr-alberto-giovanni-busetto-chief-ai-officer-at-healthai-interview-series/\">Dr. Alberto-Giovanni Busetto, Chief AI Officer at HealthAI &#8211; Interview Series</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai\">Unite.AI</a>.</p>"

They are wondering aloud if the big boom in AI investment already came and went, if a lot of market excitement and spending on massive AI training systems powered by multitudes of high-performance GPUs has played itself out, and if expectations for the AI era should be radically scaled back.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if you take a closer look at the plans of the major hyperscalers, AI investment is alive and well. Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have all recently doubled down on investing in AI technology. Their collective commitment for 2025 totals well over $300 billion, according to a recent story <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/634b7ec5-10c3-44d3-ae49-2a5b9ad566fa\">in the Financial Times</a>. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Microsoft could spend $80 billion alone on AI this year. Meta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Facebook, \u201cWe're planning to invest $60-65B in capex this year while also growing our AI teams significantly, and we have the capital to continue investing in the years ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not the sound of an AI boom going bust, but there has been a growing unease around how much money is being spent on enabling AI applications. After at least two years of technology giants saying they were seeing clear demand for more computing power to help train massive AI models, 2025 has begun with those same companies being called on the carpet daily by business media for building up so much AI hype.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why has there been such a sudden shift from hope to concern? The answer can be found partly in the rapid rise of a new AI application from China. But to fully understand what is really happening, and what it means for AI investment and technology programs in the coming years, we must acknowledge that the AI era is shifting into a new phase of its evolution.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>DeepSeeking the Truth</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By now, the world knows all about DeepSeek, the Chinese AI company touting how it used inference engines and statistical reasoning to train large language models much more efficiently and with less cost than other firms have trained their models.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, DeepSeek claimed its techniques resulted in it requiring far fewer GPUs (as few as 2,048 GPUs), as well as less powerful GPUs (Nvidia H800s) than the hundreds of thousands of premium-performance GPUs (think Nvidia H100s) that some hyperscale companies have required to train their models. In terms of cost savings, while OpenAI spent billions of dollars on training ChatGPT, DeepSeek <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/deepseek-ai-vs-openai-chatgpt#:~:text=DeepSeek%20is%20more%20affordable%20than,pretty%20big%20disparity%20in%20pricing.\">reportedly</a> spent as little as $6.5 million to train its R1 model.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It should be noted that many experts have doubted DeepSeek\u2019s spending claims, but the damage was done, as news of its different methods drove a deep plunge in the stock values of the hyperscalers and the companies whose GPUs they have spent billions on to train their AI models.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, a couple of important points were lost amid the chaos. One was an understanding that DeepSeek did not \u201cinvent\u201d a new way to work with AI. The second is that much of the AI ecosystem has been well aware of an imminent shift in how AI investment dollars need to be spent, and how AI itself will be put to work in the coming years.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding DeepSeek\u2019s methods, the notion of using AI inference engines and statistical reasoning is nothing new. The use of statistical reasoning is one aspect of the broader concept of inference model reasoning, which involves AI being able to draw inferences based on pattern recognition. This is essentially similar to the human capability to learn different ways of approaching a problem and compare them to find the best possible solution. Inference-based model reasoning can be used today and is not exclusive to a Chinese startup.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the AI ecosystem for some time already has been anticipating a fundamental change in how we work with AI and the computing resources required. The initial years of the AI era have been all about the big job of training large AI models on very large data sets, all of which required a lot of processing, complex calculations, weight adjustments, and memory reliance. After AI models have been trained, things change. AI is able to use inference to apply everything it has learned to new data sets, tasks, and problems. Inference, as a less computationally intense process than training, does not require as many GPUs or other computing resources.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ultimate truth about DeepSeek is that while its methods did not shock most of us in the AI ecosystem as much as it did casually interested stock market investors, it did highlight one of the ways in which inference will be core to the next phase of AI\u2019s evolution.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>AI: The Next Generation</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The promise and potential of AI has not changed. The ongoing massive AI investments by the major hyperscalers show the faith they have in the future value they can unlock from AI, as well as the ways in which AI can change how virtually every industry works, and how virtually all people go about their everyday lives.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What has changed for those hyperscalers is how those dollars are likely to be spent. In the initial years of the AI era, most of the investment was necessarily on training. If you think about AI as a child, with a mind still in development, we have been spending a lot of money to send it to the best schools and universities. Now, that child is an educated adult\u2013and it needs to get a job to support itself. In real world terms, we have invested a lot in training AI, and now we need to see the return on that investment by using AI to generate new revenue.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To achieve this return on investment, AI needs to become more efficient and less costly to help companies maximize its market appeal and its utility for as many applications as possible. The most lucrative new services will be the autonomous ones that don\u2019t require human monitoring and management.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many companies, that means leveraging resource-efficient AI computing techniques, such as inference model reasoning, to quickly and cost-effectively enable autonomous machine-to-machine communications. For example, in the wireless industry, AI can be used to autonomously analyze real-time data on spectrum utilization on a mobile network to optimize channel usage and mitigate interference between users, which ultimately allows a mobile operator to support more dynamic spectrum sharing across its network. This type of more efficient, autonomous AI-powered machine-to-machine communication will define AI\u2019s next generation.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As has been the case with every other major computing era, AI computing continues to evolve. If the history of computing has taught us anything, it is that new technology always requires a lot of upfront investment, but costs will come down and efficiency will go up as we start to leverage improved techniques and better practices to create more beneficial and affordable products and services to appeal to the largest possible markets. Innovation always finds a way.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AI sector may have recently appeared to suffer a setback if you listen to the AI bears, but the dollars the hyperscalers plan to spend this year and the increasing use of inference-based techniques tell a different story: AI computing is indeed changing, but AI\u2019s promise is fully intact.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/the-ai-boom-did-not-bust-but-ai-computing-is-definitely-changing/\">The AI Boom Did Not Bust, but AI Computing is Definitely Changing</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai\">Unite.AI</a>.</p>"

For example, it wasn\u2019t unusual for you to know the name of your teller\u2019s spouse and for them to know your kids\u2019 names. Indeed, personal relationships have been the hallmark of smaller financial institutions and what has set them apart from their larger competitors. The digitization of banking has made forging personal relationships a challenge, eroding the differentiator and leaving smaller institutions searching for a way to reset the board.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter <a href=\"https://hub.q2.com/blog/q2-launches-internal-ai-center-of-excellence\">generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)</a>, which is a subset of AI technologies that uses large language models (LLMs) to learn patterns from large datasets. It then uses the patterns with prompts and directions from a human to create new text content that resembles or enhances original, human-generated work.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"https://hub.q2.com/analyst-overview/2025-retail-banking-trends-and-priorities-report?utm_source=business_wire&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=fy_25_q1_retail_banking_trends_press_release&amp;utm_term=press_release&amp;utm_content=na\">2025 Retail Banking Trends and Priorities</a> report we sponsored this year found that 80% of organizations believe digital agents will rely on generative AI for real-time personalized marketing communications by 2030 and 76% of financial institutions believe that most financial institutions will be using GenAI by 2030. We actually believe the percentage should be higher, given that GenAI can substantially increase productivity, support better data-driven human decision-making, help deliver improved and more personalized digital customer experiences, and boost the bottom line significantly.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How significantly? At the end of 2023, The McKinsey Global Institute estimated that, among industries globally, <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/capturing-the-full-value-of-generative-ai-in-banking\">GenAI could add</a> the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually in value across the 63 use cases it analyzed. Among industry sectors, banking is expected to have one of the largest opportunities, with the potential to deliver between $200 and $340 billion in new value to retail banking \u2014 largely from increased productivity.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Faster, Better, Happier</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a misconception that AI will take jobs from humans. But the power of GenAI is that it produces content based on data and information <em>plus</em> prompts and directions given by humans. It\u2019s an enhancement tool, not a replacement tool.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, GenAI in banking is mostly used to automate critical but repetitive tasks or processes, including security, loan origination, fraud detection, and to deliver better automated service experiences. Allowing GenAI to take over the mundane work associated with these and other processes not only increases efficiency and productivity, it also frees up the employees doing that work to focus on more meaningful assignments, thus making their jobs more satisfying.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the primary ways regional banks and credit unions can differentiate themselves is by personalizing and elevating the digital banking experience of account holders. Specifically, the technology facilitates deeper insights into their behavior and predilections to help anticipate their needs. So, products and services that meet those needs can be offered to them in the same way Netflix offers its customers curated entertainment, and Amazon offers its customers entertainment and products \u2014 based on customer behavior and preferences.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, the data gathering and deep analysis possible with GenAI enables the creation of personalized content, so each account holder will see only content (including marketing campaigns) relevant to them at a certain time in their life. It makes no sense for a middle-aged woman who owns her own home and has a good salary and credit score to see the same content as a recent college graduate who\u2019s trying to pay off student loans and still aspires to own a home.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The Human Touch</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inclusion of human decision-making and oversight are critical to building GenAI solutions for banking. Our formula for successful integration of GenAI is to start with deep learning models trained specifically on large banking datasets. These models, which have also been trained to learn the patterns and structures of human language, then create natural responses to user queries or prompts. Human involvement is crucial to ensure that AI-generated responses are accurate and align with ethical standards, regulatory compliance and customer needs \u2014 while mitigating potential risks and biases.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Tomorrow\u2019s Tech, Today</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The potential of GenAI to transform regional banks and credit unions is unbounded. The financial institutions that succeed in integrating the technology will be those that start strategizing for the future while focusing investments on high-potential and lower-risk applications, today.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are four primary ways we see GenAI making immediate and substantial impacts in the service of banking.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Driving strategic growth </strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">The McKinsey report calculated that corporate and retail banking will benefit the most from the correct deployment of GenAI. On the corporate banking side, the highest potential is enhanced human-in-the-loop decision-making, automated risk assessment models and operational efficiencies through automation. Retail banking stands to benefit from personalized banking experiences, improved customer service and marketing innovations.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Powering operational efficiency</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">In a report on the top banking trends for 2023, <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/industry/banking/document/Accenture-Banking-Top-10-Trends-2024.pdf\">Accenture</a> identified banking as the industry most likely to be thoroughly impacted by GenAI and the industry with the greatest potential to increase output with the technology, with 34% of current workflows ripe for GenAI enhancement. It also found that financial institutions that adopt GenAI can improve their productivity by up to 30%.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">But even with the potential for GenAI to improve efficiency, human expertise remains the key to success. Using specific banking knowledge, internal teams can train the models to be accurate and to assess complexities the way humans can. But they can scale faster and to a level far beyond human capacity.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Leveling the playing field between larger and smaller institutions</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">We\u2019ve seen a few of the ways GenAI can benefit regional banks and credit unions, including increasing productivity and enabling personalized account holder experiences. It\u2019s a positive sign that notoriously risk-averse bankers are recognizing the myriad benefits of GenAI, with adoption rates rising, but we still see too many regional financial institutions hesitant to jump on board.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">While they dawdle, the big financial institutions are on the move. And they are only skimming the surface in leveraging the power of GenAI. Those who continue to be overly cautious will be permanently left behind. The thing to remember is GenAI tools can be ring-fenced, connected to proprietary data and kept internally.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Delivering collective intelligence</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">Collective intelligence is created when individuals and groups work together. Components may include group decision-making, consensus formation, ideation from different sources and motivation from competition. Traditionally, leveraging collective intelligence was done by documenting institutional knowledge and sharing it through training and job experience. GenAI elevates the benefits of collective intelligence \u2014 easily and in real time.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">\u00a0</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The successful adoption and increasing integration of GenAI in regional financial institutions will require LLMs specifically trained on banking data and deep industry knowledge. But the crucial element is human collaboration and oversight. Remember, GenAI is an enhancement tool, not a replacement tool.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-left: 40px;\">\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/the-future-of-genai-in-regional-banks-and-credit-unions/\">The Future of GenAI in Regional Banks and Credit Unions</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai\">Unite.AI</a>.</p>"

I appreciated how Relevance AI made some suggestions for inspiration.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Exploring the AI agent templates in Relevance AI.\" height=\"436\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Template-Gallery-Relevance-AI-03-17-2025_11_12_AM.png\" width=\"1200\" /></p>\n<p>Below that, I could search through different agent templates by category.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"The tool templates on Relevance AI.\" height=\"421\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Template-Gallery-Relevance-AI-03-17-2025_11_24_AM.png\" width=\"1200\" /></p>\n<p>Under the AI agent templates were the tool templates. These templates serve as starting points to create and equip AI agents with specific capabilities.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Highlighting the checklist and learning resources provided by Relevance AI.\" height=\"478\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Template-Gallery-Relevance-AI-03-17-2025_11_34_AM.png\" width=\"1200\" /></p>\n<p>On the right side panel was a checklist of things to accomplish and some helpful videos on how to use Relevance AI to start building my AI workforce. I appreciated this step-by-step guidance so I didn't have to feel overwhelmed!</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Create an AI Agent</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Creating a new agent from scratch in Relevance AI.\" height=\"513\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Agents-Relevance-AI-03-17-2025_02_04_PM.png\" width=\"1200\" /></p>\n<p>To create your first AI agent, select &#8220;Agents&#8221; and hit &#8220;New Agent&#8221; on the top right.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Fill Out the Agent Profile</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Changing an AI Agent's profile picture and giving it a name and description of its role with Relevance AI.\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Loading.-_-Relevance-AI-1.png\" width=\"1133\" /></p>\n<p>Start by choosing your AI Avatar's profile image by clicking on it. Next, enter your agent's name and a brief description of its role.</p>\n<p>I wanted to create an AI agent that handles leads collected by Hubspot. I named my agent &#8220;LeadLinker&#8221; with the following description:</p>\n<p>&#8220;LeadLinker is a smart, efficient AI agent designed to manage and optimize leads collected through HubSpot. It automatically qualifies, categorizes, and nurtures leads, ensuring timely follow-ups and personalized communication. LeadLinker analyzes lead behavior, tracks engagement, and suggests tailored strategies to boost conversion rates. It seamlessly integrates with your HubSpot CRM, keeping your sales team informed and focused on the most promising opportunities.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Integrate the Necessary Platforms</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Choosing a platform to integrate to create a trigger on Relevance AI.\" height=\"449\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Relevance-AI-03-17-2025_02_24_PM.png\" width=\"1200\" /></p>\n<p>Scrolling a bit further down are your AI agent's &#8220;Triggers&#8221; which can be found in the &#8220;Integrations&#8221; section. These triggers are how you give your AI Agents tasks to complete.</p>\n<p>While the simplest way to give your AI agent a task to complete is by sending it a message, you'll often want to give your agent work from external systems. Since I want to create an AI agent that handles leads collected by Hubspot, I would connect my Hubspot.</p>\n<p>In addition to these triggers, you can also create custom webhooks and API triggers.</p>\n<h3>Step 6: Add Core Instructions</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Adding Core Instructions to tell an AI Agent on Relevance AI how I want it to work.\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Loading.-_-Relevance-AI-2.png\" width=\"1128\" /></p>\n<p>Select &#8220;Core Instructions&#8221; from the left panel menu to tell your AI agent how you want it to work. You can do this by providing role information and examples of the tasks it might receive and how to handle them. If you want your agent to use a tool, hit &#8220;/&#8221; on your keyboard!</p>\n<h3>Step 7: Give Your Agent Abilities</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Adding abilities to an AI agent in Relevance AI.\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lead-Sorting-and-Assignment-in-HubSpot-_-Relevance-AI.png\" width=\"1124\" /></p>\n<p>While you can send your AI agent basic tasks to complete, it's much more helpful to give them abilities and tools. Otherwise, Relevance AI would just be another LLM!</p>\n<p>Hit &#8220;Abilities&#8221; in the left panel menu. You'll need to be on the Business plan to enable scheduled messages, but you can allow your agent to escalate to you when it doesn't know how to act on the Pro plan.</p>\n<p>The Escalation feature lets you add an email or Slack channel where your AI agent will reach out to a human if it can't handle situations on its own. Just add your email or Slack channel!</p>\n<h3>Step 8: Add Tools</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Adding tools to an AI Agent in Relevance AI.\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lead-Sorting-and-Assignment-in-HubSpot-_-Relevance-AI-1.png\" width=\"1117\" /></p>\n<p>To enhance your AI agent's capabilities further, select &#8220;Tools.&#8221; This is how you give your AI agents specific skills (like searching the Internet, analyzing PDFs, etc.)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Adding custom and prebuilt tools in Relevance AI.\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lead-Sorting-and-Assignment-in-HubSpot-_-Relevance-AI-3.png\" width=\"1118\" /></p>\n<p>Add custom tools by hitting &#8220;Add tool,&#8221; or select prebuilt tools from the wide selection of templates. Once you've found a tool you want to add, hit &#8220;Add&#8221; next to it.</p>\n<h3>Step 9: Choose the Approval Mode</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Selecting a tool that has been added and choosing how the AI agent will use it on Relevance AI.\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Edit-Post-Relevance-AI-Review-\u2039-Unite.AI-\u2014-WordPress.png\" width=\"1200\" /></p>\n<p>Once the tool has been added, select it from your tools. From there, choose from three different ways for how you want your AI agent to use the tool:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Auto run (the AI agent will always run the tool when it needs to)</li>\n<li>Approval required (the AI agent will always ask for your approval before running the tool and you can customize how the tool runs)</li>\n<li>Let agent decide (the AI agent chooses between auto run and requiring approval)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Step 10: Edit the Advanced Settings</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Making adjustments to the advanced settings when creating an AI agent in Relevance AI.\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lead-Sorting-and-Assignment-in-HubSpot-_-Relevance-AI-4.png\" width=\"1121\" /></p>\n<p>Last but not least, go to &#8220;Advanced Settings.&#8221; Here's where you can choose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/best-large-language-models-llms/\">language model</a> that powers your AI agent's decisions</li>\n<li>How long your AI agent runs (15 minutes or 24 hours &#8211; available on the Business plan)</li>\n<li>How many times your AI agent will retry a tool that fails</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And that's how you can start creating and setting up AI agents with Relevance AI!</p>\n<p>Overall, Relevance AI made it easy to create and customize my AI agent for managing HubSpot leads. The clear step-by-step guidance, intuitive dashboard, and variety of templates allowed me to set up my agent effortlessly without feeling overwhelmed.</p>\n<h2>Top 3 Relevance AI Alternatives</h2>\n<p>Here are the best Relevance AI alternatives I'd recommend.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://skills.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Skills.ai</a></h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Skills.ai homepage.\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-19-092700.png\" width=\"1130\" /></p>\n<p>The first Relevance AI alternative I'd recommend is Skills.ai.

Although it is possible to train AI systems to auto-caption videos, a great many human-generated examples are still needed as ground truth, for variety and coverage.</p>\n<p>More importantly, almost every current AI-based video-captioning model <em><i>operates at 1fps</i></em>, which is not a dense enough capture rate to discern variations in a great many scenarios: sudden micro-expression changes for emotion-recognition systems; rapid events in high-speed sports such as basketball; violent movements; rapid cuts in dramatic movies, where systems such as <a href=\"https://www.scenedetect.com/\">PySceneDetect</a> may fail to identify them (or are not being used); and many other scenarios where the window of attention clearly needs to be more intense.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-video\" style=\"width: 740px;\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"425\" id=\"video-214079-1\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"740\"><source src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Higgins_1982.mp4?_=1\" type=\"video/mp4\" /><a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Higgins_1982.mp4\">https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Higgins_1982.mp4</a></video></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><strong><em><i>Click to play. </i></em></strong><em><i>Rapid but life-changing action in what can otherwise be one of the slowest sports in the world, as Alex Higgins clinches the world championship against Ray Reardon in 1982.</i></em> Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1PuqKno_Ok</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Move Fast and Break Logic</strong></h2>\n<p>This low rate is the standard for various logistical reasons. For one, video-captioning is a resource-intensive activity, whether the system is studying one sequential frame at a time, or else using various methods to semantically cohere a string of frames into an interpretable caption sequence. In either case, the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/context-window\">context window</a> is inevitably limited by hardware constraints.</p>\n<p>Another reason for 1fps being the current standard is that videos are not generally stuffed with rapid events; it is therefore redundant to give 300 frames of static snooker table the same attention as the split-second in which a potted black ball wins the championship (see example above).</p>\n<p>It is possible to use broader secondary cues to identify pivotal moments in a sports video, such as the sustained crowd reaction to a rapid slam-dunk in a basketball game.\u00a0However, such clues may occur for other reasons (such as unexpected player injuries), and can't be relied on. This is one example of how a mislabeled video dataset can lead to a generative video model that hallucinates or misinterprets instructions, i.e., because the model might show a player injury when it was asked to generate a slam-dunk (because the &#8216;secondary clue' of crowd-agitation was not exclusive to one specific type of event).</p>\n<p>This is in many ways a &#8216;budgetary' problem, and in other ways a procedural problem. Frameworks to date have operated on the principle that sparse keyframes can effectively capture essential information, but this is more effective in establishing genre and other facets of a video's subject matter, since evidence, in that case, persists over multiple frames.</p>\n<h2><strong>F-16</strong></h2>\n<p>A new paper from China is offering a solution, in the form of the first multimodal large language model (MLLM, or simply LLM) that can analyze video <em><i>at 16fps</i></em> instead of the standard 1fps, while avoiding the major pitfalls of increasing the analysis rate.</p>\n<p>In tests, the authors claim that the new system, titled <em><i>F-16</i></em>, outperforms proprietary state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o and Google's Gemini-1.5 pro. While other current models were able to match or exceed F-16's results in trials, the competing models were far larger and unwieldier.</p>\n<p>Though F-16 was trained on some serious hardware (as we'll examine shortly), inference is usually far less demanding than training. Therefore we can hope that the code (promised for a near-future release) will be capable of running on medium or high-level domestic GPUs .</p>\n<p>What's needed for the vitality of the hobbyist scene (and that includes the professional VFX scene, most of the time) is a video-captioning model of this kind that can operate, perhaps <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/comparing-quantization-techniques-for-scalable-vector-search/\">quantized</a>, on consumer systems, so that the entire generative video scene does not migrate to API-based commercial systems, or force consumers to hook local frameworks up to commercial online GPU services.</p>\n<h3>Beyond Scaling Up</h3>\n<p>The authors observe that this kind of approach is a practical alternative to scaling up datasets. One can infer also that if you were going to throw more data at the problem, this is still the kind of approach that could be preferable, because the new system distinguishes events in a more granular way.</p>\n<p>They state:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em><i>&#8216;Low frame rate sampling can result in critical visual information loss, particularly in videos with rapidly changing scenes, intricate details, or fast motion.

Each frame is first processed by a pretrained image encoder, extracting feature representations before being passed to an aligner based on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08415\">Gaussian Error Linear Units</a> (GELUs).</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_214089\" style=\"width: 824px;\"><img alt=\"F-16\u2019s architecture processes video at 16 FPS, capturing more frames than traditional low-frame-rate models, and its high-frame-rate aligner preserves visual semantics while efficiently encoding motion dynamics without adding extra visual tokens.

A spatial <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/deepface-for-advanced-facial-recognition/\">max-pooling</a> layer further compresses the token count, keeping computational costs within bounds.</p>\n<p>The processed video tokens are then fed into the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10671\">Qwen2-7B</a> LLM, which generates textual responses based on the extracted visual features and a given user prompt.</p>\n<p>By structuring video input this way, F-16 enables, the authors assert, more precise event recognition in dynamic scenes, while still maintaining efficiency.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Short Version</strong></h3>\n<p>F-16 extends a pretrained image LLM, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03326\">LLaVA-OneVision</a>, to process video by transforming its visual input pipeline. While standard image LLMs handle isolated frames, F-16's high-frame-rate aligner reformats multiple frames into a form the model can more efficiently process; this avoids overwhelming the system with redundant information while preserving key motion cues necessary for accurate video understanding.</p>\n<p>To ensure compatibility with its image-based foundation, F-16 reuses pretrained parameters by restructuring its aligner into <em><i>sub-matrices</i></em>. This approach allows it to integrate knowledge from single-frame models while adapting to sequential video input.</p>\n<p>The aligner first compresses frame sequences into a format optimized for the LLM, preserving the most informative features while discarding unnecessary details. The architecture design enables the system to process high-frame-rate video while keeping computational demands under control, which the authors posit as evidence that scaling is not the only (or the best) way forward for video captioning.</p>\n<h3><strong>Varying the Pace</strong></h3>\n<p>Since processing video at 16 FPS improves motion understanding but increases computational cost, particularly during inference, F-16 introduces a <em><i>variable-frame-rate decoding</i></em> method, allowing it to adjust frame rate dynamically without retraining.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_214090\" style=\"width: 517px;\"><img alt=\"The single-frame and high frame rate aligners available to F-16.\" class=\" wp-image-214090\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/figure-2.jpg\" width=\"507\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-214090\"><em>The single-frame and high frame rate aligners available to F-16.</em></p></div>\n<p>This flexibility enables the model to operate efficiently at lower FPS when high precision isn\u2019t required, and reduces computational overhead.</p>\n<p>At test time, when a lower frame rate is selected, F-16 reuses previously trained aligner parameters by repeating input frames to match the expected dimensions. This ensures the model can still process video effectively without modifying its architecture.</p>\n<p>Unlike naive downsampling (i.e., simply removing frames), which risks losing critical motion details, this method preserves the aligner\u2019s learned motion representations, maintaining accuracy even at reduced frame rates. For general video comprehension, a lower FPS setting can speed up inference without significant performance loss, while high-speed motion analysis can still leverage the full 16 FPS capability.</p>\n<h2><strong>Data and Tests</strong></h2>\n<p>Built on Qwen2-7B, FP-16 extends LLaVA-OneVision using <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15343\">SigLIP</a> as an image encoder. With video frames sampled at 16 FPS, up to 1,760 frames can be obtained from each video. For longer video clips, frames were uniformly (i.e., more sparsely) sampled.</p>\n<p>For training, F-16 used the same general video datasets as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02713\">LLaVA-Video</a>, including <a href=\"https://llava-vl.github.io/blog/2024-09-30-llava-video/\">LLaVA-Video-178K</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/doc-doc/NExT-QA\">NExT-QA</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/MILVLG/activitynet-qa\">ActivityNet-QA</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/google-deepmind/perception_test\">PerceptionTest</a>.</p>\n<p>F-16 was additionally fine-tuned on the high-speed sports datasets <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06704\">FineGym</a>, <a href=\"http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/projects/resound/dataset.html\">Diving48</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04527\">SoccerNet</a>.

The method by which events are isolated/extracted from otherwise long and tedious tracts of video (as with golf or snooker video clips, for instance) will benefit from a rethink of the semantic approaches and mechanisms currently dominating SOTA solutions \u2013 because some of these limitations were established in more resource-impoverished times.</p>\n<p><em><i>(incidentally, even if 16fps seems like a very low frame rate for 2025, it is interesting to note that this is also the native training speed of video clips used in the hugely popular <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/why-ai-video-sometimes-gets-it-backwards/\">Wan 2.1</a> generative video model, and the speed at which it therefore operates with fewest issues.

However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs primarily operate by predicting the next word or token based on preceding words. This approach limits their ability for deeper understanding, logical reasoning, and maintaining long-term coherence in complex tasks.</p>\n<p>To address these challenges, a new architecture has emerged in AI: <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/large-concept-models-language-modeling-in-a-sentence-representation-space/\">Large Concept Models (LCMs)</a>. Unlike traditional LLMs, LCMs don't focus solely on individual words. Instead, they operate on entire concepts, representing complete thoughts embedded in sentences or phrases. This higher-level approach allows LCMs to better mirror how humans think and plan before writing.</p>\n<p>In this article, we\u2019ll explore the transition from LLMs to LCMs and how these new models are transforming the way AI understands and generates language. We will also discuss the limitations of LCMs and highlight future research directions aimed at making LCMs more effective.</p>\n<h2>The Evolution from Large Language Models to Large Concept Models</h2>\n<p>LLMs are trained to predict the next token in a sequence, given the preceding context. While this has enabled LLMs to perform tasks such as summarization, code generation, and language translation, their reliance on generating one word at a time limits their ability to maintain coherent and logical structures, especially for long-form or complex tasks. Humans, on the other hand, perform reasoning and planning before writing the text. We don\u2019t tackle a complex communication task by reacting one word at a time; instead, we think in terms of ideas and higher-level units of meaning.</p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re preparing a speech or writing a paper, you typically start by sketching an outline \u2013 the key points or concepts you want to convey \u2013 and then write details in words and sentences\u200b. The language you use to communicate those ideas may vary, but the underlying concepts remain the same. This suggests that meaning, the essence of communication, can be represented at a higher level than individual words.</p>\n<p>This insight has inspired AI researchers to develop models that operate on concepts instead of just words, leading to the creation of Large Concept Models (LCMs).</p>\n<h2>What Are Large Concept Models (LCMs)?</h2>\n<p>LCMs are a new class of AI models that process information at the level of concepts, rather than individual words or tokens. In contrast to traditional LLMs, which predict the next word one at a time, LCMs work with larger units of meaning, typically entire sentences or complete ideas. By using concept embedding \u2014 numerical vectors that represent the meaning of a whole sentence \u2014 LCMs can capture the core meaning of a sentence without relying on specific words or phrases.</p>\n<p>For example, while an LLM might process the sentence \u201cThe quick brown fox\u201d word by word, an LCM would represent this sentence as a single concept. By handling sequences of concepts, LCMs are better able to model the logical flow of ideas in a way that ensures clarity and coherence. This is equivalent to how humans outline ideas before writing an essay. By structuring their thoughts first, they ensure that their writing flows logically and coherently, building the required narrative in step-by-step fashion.</p>\n<h2>How LCMs Are Trained?</h2>\n<p>Training LCMs follows a <a href=\"https://scontent.fisb1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/470149925_936340665123313_5359535905316748287_n.pdf?_nc_cat=103&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=3c67a6&amp;_nc_ohc=1LguVZudXi8Q7kNvgG7LZju&amp;_nc_oc=AdkKfwdgXbcrQXBDcl0tYknjue_1j5zsiJIfwS4ytTMq2hqa7csQYlIPdaBVeVOds5HU1IRmWLOV4FhtpoiiGh37&amp;_nc_zt=14&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fisb1-2.fna&amp;_nc_gid=7BcaNeaOi0kCzuWQkc4Prw&amp;oh=00_AYEwema0r03beK_QmpMu17scF5GDqk-ltdVxHxlUeCJ_KA&amp;oe=67DF9992\">process</a> similar to that of LLMs, but with an important distinction. While LLMs are trained to predict the next word at each step, LCMs are trained to predict the next concept. To do this, LCMs use a neural network, often based on a transformer decoder, to predict the next concept embedding given the previous ones.</p>\n<p>An encoder-decoder architecture is used to translate between raw text and the concept embeddings. The encoder converts input text into semantic embeddings, while the decoder translates the model\u2019s output embeddings back into natural language sentences. This architecture allows LCMs to work beyond any specific language, as the model does not need to &#8220;know&#8221; if it's processing English, French, or Chinese text, the input is transformed into a concept-based vector that extends beyond any specific language.</p>\n<h2>Key Benefits of LCMs</h2>\n<p>The ability to work with concepts rather than individual words enables LCM to offer several <a href=\"https://adasci.org/a-deep-dive-into-large-concept-models-lcms/\">benefits</a> over LLMs. Some of these benefits are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Global Context Awareness</strong><br />\nBy processing text in larger units rather than isolated words, LCMs can better understand broader meanings and maintain a clearer understanding of the overall narrative. For example, when summarizing a novel, an LCM captures the plot and themes, rather than getting trapped by individual details.</li>\n<li><strong> Hierarchical Planning and Logical Coherence</strong><br />\nLCMs employ hierarchical planning to first identify high-level concepts, then build coherent sentences around them. This structure ensures a logical flow, significantly reducing redundancy and irrelevant information.</li>\n<li><strong> Language-Agnostic Understanding</strong><br />\nLCMs encode concepts that are independent of language-specific expressions, allowing for a universal representation of meaning. This capability allows LCMs to generalize knowledge across languages, helping them work effectively with multiple languages, even those they haven\u2019t been explicitly trained on.</li>\n<li><strong> Enhanced Abstract Reasoning</strong><br />\nBy manipulating concept embeddings instead of individual words, LCMs better align with human-like thinking, enabling them to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. They can use these conceptual representations as an internal &#8220;scratchpad,&#8221; aiding in tasks like multi-hop question-answering and logical inferences.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Challenges and Ethical Considerations</h2>\n<p>Despite their advantages, LCMs introduce several challenges. First, they incur substantial computational costs as they involves additional complexity of encoding and decoding high-dimensional concept embeddings. Training these models requires significant resources and careful optimization to ensure efficiency and scalability.</p>\n<p>Interpretability also becomes challenging, as reasoning occurs at an abstract, conceptual level. Understanding why a model generated a particular outcome can be less transparent, posing risks in sensitive domains like legal or medical decision-making. Furthermore, ensuring fairness and mitigating biases embedded in training data remain critical concerns. Without proper safeguards, these models could inadvertently perpetuate or even amplify existing biases.</p>\n<h2>Future Directions of LCM Research</h2>\n<p>LCMs is an emerging research area in the field of AI and LLMs. Future advancements in LCMs will likely focus on scaling models, refining concept representations, and enhancing explicit reasoning capabilities. As models grow beyond billions of parameters, it's expected that their reasoning and generation abilities will increasingly match or exceed current state-of-the-art LLMs. Furthermore, developing flexible, dynamic methods for segmenting concepts and incorporating multimodal data (e.g., images, audio) will push LCMs to deeply understand relationships across different modalities, such as visual, auditory, and textual information. This will allow LCMs to make more accurate connections between concepts, empowering AI with richer and deeper understanding of the world.</p>\n<p>There is also potential for integrating LCM and LLM strengths through hybrid systems, where concepts are used for high-level planning and tokens for detailed and smooth text generation. These hybrid models could address a wide range of tasks, from creative writing to technical problem-solving. This could lead to the development of more intelligent, adaptable, and efficient AI systems capable of handling complex real-world applications.</p>\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>Large Concept Models (LCMs) are an evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), moving from individual words to entire concepts or ideas. This evolution enables AI to think and plan before generating the text. This leads to improved coherence in long-form content, enhanced performance in creative writing and narrative building, and the ability to handle multiple languages. Despite challenges like high computational costs and interpretability, LCMs have the potential to greatly enhance AI\u2019s ability to tackle real-world problems. Future advancements, including hybrid models combining the strengths of both LLMs and LCMs, could result in more intelligent, adaptable, and efficient AI systems, capable of addressing a wide range of applications.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/from-words-to-concepts-how-large-concept-models-are-redefining-language-understanding-and-generation/\">From Words to Concepts: How Large Concept Models Are Redefining Language Understanding and Generation</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai\">Unite.AI</a>.</p>"

Lenchner is a strong advocate for keeping public web data open and accessible, emphasizing its critical role in driving innovation.</p>\n<p><strong>What inspired your journey into the world of data and AI, and since becoming CEO in 2018, how have you shaped Bright Data\u2019s mission and vision?</strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the power of data, particularly with how it can drive decisions and fuel innovation. When used right, data can also drive transparency in business. Becoming CEO of Bright Data in 2018 gave me an opportunity to help shape how AI researchers and businesses go about sourcing and utilizing public web data.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the key challenges AI teams face in sourcing large-scale public web data, and how does Bright Data address them?</strong></p>\n<p>Scalability remains one of the biggest challenges for AI teams. Since AI models require massive amounts of data, efficient collection is no small task. And since AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on, ensuring teams have access to fresh, high-quality data is a constant challenge. This is especially true as the web evolves in real time.</p>\n<p>Another major concern is compliance. Data privacy laws and requirements continuously evolve, so AI teams need to always be aware of those changes. They also have to understand how to deal with websites that enforce anti-bot mechanisms, which can complicate the data gathering process.</p>\n<p>The platform that we\u2019ve built at Bright Data takes care of these challenges. We provide scalable, automated data collection that delivers structured real-time data. Our AI-driven tools clean and validate data to ensure accuracy. We have strict measures in place to ensure legal and ethical data collection for compliance. The idea is to empower AI teams to focus on building great models, while we handle the complexities of data sourcing.</p>\n<p><strong>How does high-quality web data contribute to AI model performance, and what are the best practices for ensuring data accuracy?</strong></p>\n<p>High-quality data means data that is complete, free from biases, and most importantly, accurate. If data is lacking or mired in inconsistencies and mistakes, the resulting AI model won\u2019t perform according to expectations.</p>\n<p>To achieve accuracy, it\u2019s best to source data from a variety of public sources that have established reliability. Using only a few, or worse, a single data source, results in problems such as incompleteness. Having multiple sources provides the ability to cross-reference data and build a more balanced and well-represented dataset. Additionally, organizations should consider automated data validation and cleansing, to efficiently get rid of erroneous and inconsistent data.</p>\n<p>At Bright Data, we take all of these factors into account. We provide AI teams with structured and real-time data that has been validated for accuracy. That way, they can train models with confidence.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the biggest ethical concerns in public web data collection today?</strong></p>\n<p>Privacy remains to be one of the biggest concerns in public web data collection. People worry about their data getting exposed to abuse and misuse. To make sure that data remains private, it is vital to emphasize transparency. Organizations that accumulate data must be upfront regarding the data they collect. It is important to assure the public that their data is used under strict ethical guidelines.</p>\n<p>One other major concern is monopolization. Certain large companies have control over a vast amount of data, which creates an uneven playing field wherein only a select few have access to information necessary to train AI models and drive innovation. This is not how things should be. Public web data should remain accessible to businesses, researchers, and developers. That way, AI development is not concentrated in the hands of just a few major players.</p>\n<p>Ethics are not an afterthought at Bright Data. They\u2019re embedded into every decision we make. We do not just follow industry standards \u2013 we set them. We lead in the data collection industry in defining the right ethical standards. We want to ensure that public web data is accessed responsibly, transparently, and in full compliance with global regulations.</p>\n<p><strong>How does Bright Data ensure compliance with global data privacy regulations while still enabling large-scale data collection?</strong></p>\n<p>Our organization is committed to adhering to global legal and regulatory requirements on data gathering and utilization. We see to it that we comply with the requirements of GDPR, CPRA, CCPA, and other relevant regulations. Importantly, we strictly follow Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols to ensure that only legitimate users get to access our platform. Our data solutions may only be accessed by legitimate businesses and researchers.</p>\n<p>Our Acceptable Use Policy is also clear in defining what data can and cannot be collected. This includes responsible use. We have a dedicated compliance team responsible for the continuous monitoring of regulations to ascertain that we are up to date with the latest legal and regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p>Regardless, we still believe that public web data should remain accessible. Our goal is to provide AI teams with the data they need while ensuring compliance with privacy and legal standards.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you balance business growth with maintaining ethical data collection practices?</strong></p>\n<p>We always think of ethics and growth as not mutually exclusive. The trust of our customers and the relationship we build with them are paramount concerns. We understand that we may only achieve long-term success if we collect data under transparent terms and in accordance with applicable laws.</p>\n<p>Thus, we put in place a strict vetting protocol for our users. This is designed to ensure that the data we collect is used ethically. We allocate time, effort, and resources towards compliance and security to protect our customers and the public in general. By observing ethical data collection, we succeed business-wise while contributing to the establishment of a transparent and responsible AI ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>How does Bright Data stay ahead of regulatory changes in data privacy?</strong></p>\n<p>We understand that our data use processes and policies inevitably have to change to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulations. As such, we regularly consult legal experts and communicate with regulatory bodies. We also engage in discussions with legislators and others involved in policy building, providing input in the crafting of meaningful data regulations. We aim to strike a balance between innovation and data privacy.</p>\n<p>Our data collection and use framework evolves as new laws are issued and regulations revised. We have a compliance team that proactively updates our data use policies to make sure that our platform is always fully compliant. Moreover, we operate customer education initiatives to promote ethical data use.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the emerging trends in AI data collection that companies should be aware of?</strong></p>\n<p>Real-time data collection is becoming a must for today\u2019s AI models. It is crucial for them to access the latest or freshest data to deliver a high level of accuracy and provide better user experiences.</p>\n<p>Another notable trend is the reliance on synthetic data used for data augmentation, wherein AI generates data that supplements datasets gathered from real-world scenarios.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m also seeing strong interest in pursuing explainable AI. Most of the AI models at present suffer from the black box effect, or a lack of transparency in their decision making processes. Companies are seeking to change this paradigm by creating AI models that can detail how they arrived at the outputs or decisions they make.</p>\n<p>Lastly, companies are aware of growing data privacy concerns. That\u2019s why AI techniques aimed at preserving data privacy, such as federated learning, are becoming in-demand. Organizations want to maximize AI model training without any user data privacy compromises.</p>\n<p>We make sure we are on top of these trends, so we can build solutions that allow AI teams to keep a competitive edge.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you see AI-powered agents and automation changing the data collection landscape?</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, AI models make use of structured datasets that are mostly collected manually. These datasets also go through preprocessing, cleansing, and other procedures that usually involve human intervention. This is set to change in the near future with the rise of AI agents for autonomous collection and processing of data for AI training. They make it possible to automatically learn from real-time web data at an unprecedented scale.</p>\n<p>We have created infrastructure that supports the deployment and evolution of AI agents, enabling smooth access to high-quality, real-time data on the web. This technology allows sophisticated AI systems to continuously interface with dynamic web data, learn from it, and grow bigger and better.</p>\n<p>AI agents can transform industries as they allow AI systems to access and learn from constantly changing datasets on the web instead of relying on static and manually processed data. This can lead to banking or cybersecurity AI chatbots, for example, that are capable of coming up with decisions that reflect the most recent realities. This results in massive efficiency advances and more areas for automation.</p>\n<p>At Bright Data, we are not only enabling this transformation in the data collection landscape. We believe we are at the forefront, introducing a technology that ushers the next generation of artificial intelligence. We are excited to assist businesses and AI teams as they harness the full potential of AI agents for their operations.</p>\n<p><em>Thank you for the great interview, readers who wish to learn more should visit <a href=\"https://brightdata.com/\">Bright Data</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/or-lenchner-ceo-of-bright-data-interview-series/\">Or Lenchner, CEO of Bright Data &#8211; Interview Series</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai\">Unite.AI</a>.</p>"

For years, the narrative around quantum computing has been clouded by skepticism, fueled by early hype that outpaced delivery. Industry leaders like <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/could-we-achieve-agi-within-5-years-nvidias-ceo-jensen-huang-believes-its-possible/\">Jensen Huang</a> have reinforced the idea that practical quantum computing is decades away. While you can\u2019t fault him for talking about his book, this perception benefits companies invested in classical computing. The reality is different. Quantum computing is making meaningful progress, and the organizations that control the narrative will dictate who reaps the economic and strategic benefits.</p>\n<p>Framing the conversation around quantum computing requires a shift from purely technical discussions to real-world applications. The average executive doesn\u2019t need to understand quantum superposition or entanglement; they need to know how quantum computing can solve problems that classical computing cannot. This is where messaging matters. <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/category/artificial-intelligence/\">AI</a> faced a similar challenge until GPT models put their capabilities in front of people. Before that, AI was a concept. Now, it\u2019s a tool. The same transition must happen for quantum computing.</p>\n<h2><strong>Shaping the Quantum Narrative</strong></h2>\n<p>The biggest obstacle to quantum adoption isn\u2019t the technology itself, it\u2019s the perception that it\u2019s still theoretical. Early breakthroughs in quantum computing were so exciting that they created unrealistic expectations. When those expectations weren\u2019t immediately met, skepticism took hold. This isn\u2019t unique to <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/quantum-computing-the-future-of-data-driven-decision-making/\">quantum computing</a>. AI, blockchain, and even the internet faced similar cycles of hype and doubt. The companies that successfully moved past this skepticism did so by shifting the conversation from what the technology is to what it does.</p>\n<p>For quantum computing, that means taking complex concepts and making them tangible. Supply chain and logistics provide a useful analogy. Before COVID-19, most people didn\u2019t think about supply chains. Then, when furniture deliveries were delayed by six to nine months, the problem became real. Once the issue was explained &#8211; factories shutting down, shipping backlogs, material shortages &#8211; people understood. Quantum computing needs a similar shift. Instead of discussing qubits and error rates, companies should be explaining how quantum computing can optimize drug discovery, improve financial modeling, or enhance <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/considering-the-convergence-of-cybersecurity-and-ai/\">cybersecurity</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Geopolitical Stakes\u00a0 </strong></h2>\n<p>Quantum computing isn\u2019t just another technology, it\u2019s a national security asset. The competition between the United States and China in quantum research is a <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/01/03/137969/us-china-quantum-arms-race/\">modern arms race</a>. Whoever achieves quantum supremacy first will have a strategic advantage in encryption, intelligence, and economic leadership. Governments recognize this, which is why national policies and funding initiatives are accelerating. The <a href=\"https://www.quantum.gov/\">U.S. National Quantum Initiative</a> and China\u2019s multi-billion-dollar investments in quantum research aren\u2019t just about scientific progress, they\u2019re about securing dominance.</p>\n<p>For companies in this space, this geopolitical reality presents both <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2024-07-huge-quantum-technologies-discuss.html\">risks</a> and opportunities. On one hand, national security concerns may lead to tighter regulations and restrictions on quantum research collaborations. On the other hand, government funding and strategic partnerships can provide significant advantages. The key is to balance national interests with global collaboration. Companies that position themselves as leaders in secure quantum applications will have an edge in securing both government contracts and private-sector partnerships.</p>\n<h2><strong>Differentiation in a Crowded Market </strong></h2>\n<p>Quantum computing companies face a <a href=\"https://5wpr.net/quantum-computing-in-2025-ten-publicity-trends-shaping-the-future/\">branding</a> problem. Many claim to have the best qubits, the most scalable platforms, or the highest fidelity. But for most buyers, these claims are meaningless. Unlike traditional enterprise technology, where buyers can compare specs, quantum computing is still too complex for most decision-makers to evaluate on technical merit alone. This is why differentiation must go beyond raw performance metrics.</p>\n<p>Successful companies in this space are learning from <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/the-future-of-ai-for-business-infrastructure-why-private-bare-metal-solutions-powered-by-apple-silicon-are-ideal-for-it-departments/\">Apple</a>\u2019s playbook. Instead of hyping its technical prowess, Apple focused on simplicity and user experience. Instead of leading with qubit counts, QC companies should be leading with application and problem solving. A company that positions itself as the leader in quantum-powered financial modeling or pharmaceutical research will stand out far more than one that simply claims to have the best hardware. Partnerships also play a key role. Aligning with major industry players, whether in finance, healthcare, or cybersecurity, adds credibility and provides real-world proof points.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Talent Problem </strong></h2>\n<p>The quantum computing talent pool is small. While the good news is that the number of physics PhDs conferred each year is rising, estimates suggest fewer than 10,000 PhDs are actively working in the field, and many of them have been absorbed by finance and other industries. This means companies aren\u2019t just competing for customers; they\u2019re competing for the people who will build the future of quantum computing.</p>\n<p>Attracting top talent in this space requires more than just competitive salaries. Employer branding matters. Companies that position themselves as research hubs, foster collaborations with top universities, and offer clear career growth paths will have a better chance of securing the best minds. The <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/quantum-processing-units-the-future-of-computing/\">quantum industry</a> also needs to expand its talent pipeline. Investing in training programs, internships, and partnerships with academic institutions will be critical for long-term growth.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overcoming Adoption Barriers</strong></h2>\n<p>Most enterprises are quantum-curious but hesitant to invest. The biggest roadblock is ROI. Executives want to know when quantum computing will deliver measurable value, and right now, the timeline is unclear. This mirrors the early days of AI, when companies were spending more on AI development than they were saving from AI-driven efficiencies. That equation is shifting for AI, and it will shift for quantum computing as well.</p>\n<p>To accelerate adoption, companies need to shift their messaging. Instead of focusing on how advanced their technology is, they need to focus on how it solves real business problems. A pharmaceutical company doesn\u2019t care about quantum error correction; it cares about finding new drug compounds faster. A financial firm doesn\u2019t need to understand quantum algorithms; it needs better risk modeling. The companies that can make this connection clear will be the ones that drive early enterprise adoption.</p>\n<p>The quantum arms race isn\u2019t just about who builds the best technology; it\u2019s about who tells the most compelling story. Quantum computing is moving from theory to reality, but outdated perceptions are slowing its adoption. Companies that successfully shift the narrative from abstract science to practical applications will define the future of this industry. Governments, enterprises, and investors are paying attention. The question is, who will shape what they see?</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/the-quantum-arms-race-isnt-just-about-tech-its-about-who-controls-the-narrative/\">The Quantum Arms Race Isn\u2019t Just About Tech, It\u2019s About Who Controls the Narrative</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai\">Unite.AI</a>.</p>"

The accessibility of these tools undermines the integrity of certification testing, even when cameras are used.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other forms of GenAI, as well as <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/what-are-deepfakes/\">deepfakes</a>, pose a threat to test security. <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/best-large-language-models-llms/\">Large Language Models</a> (LLMs) are at the heart of a global technological race, with tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as Chinese rivals like DeepSeek, making big bets on them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of these models have made headlines for their ability to pass prestigious, high-stakes exams. As with deepfakes, bad actors have wielded LLMs to exploit weaknesses in traditional test security norms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some companies have begun to offer browser extensions that launch AI assistants, which are hard to detect, allowing them to access the answers to high-stakes tests. Less sophisticated uses of the technology still pose threats, including candidates going undetected using AI apps on their phones while sitting exams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, new test security procedures can offer ways to ensure exam integrity against these methods.</span></p>\n<h2><b>How to Mitigate Risks While Reaping the Benefits of Generative AI</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the numerous and rapidly evolving applications of GenAI to cheat on tests, there is a parallel race ongoing in the test security industry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same technology that threatens testing can also be used to protect the integrity of exams and provide increased assurances to firms that the candidates they hire are qualified for the job. Due to the constantly changing threats, solutions must be creative and adopt a multi-layered approach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One innovative way of reducing the threats posed by GenAI is dual-camera proctoring. This technique entails </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">using the candidate\u2019s mobile device as a second camera, providing a second video feed to detect cheating.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a more comprehensive view of the candidate's testing environment, proctors can better detect the use of multiple monitors or external devices that might be hidden outside the typical webcam view.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can also make it easier to detect the use of deepfakes to disguise proxy test-taking, as the software relies on face-swapping; a view of the entire body can reveal discrepancies between the deepfake and the person sitting for the exam.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subtle cues\u2014like mismatches in lighting or facial geometry\u2014become more apparent when compared across two separate video feeds. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This makes it easier to detect deepfakes, which are generally flat, two-dimensional representations of faces.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The added benefit of dual-camera proctoring is that it effectively ties up a candidate's phone, meaning it cannot be used for cheating. Dual-camera proctoring is even further enhanced by the use of AI, which improves the detection of cheating on the live video feed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI effectively provides a \u2018second set of eyes\u2019 that can constantly focus on the live-streamed video. If the AI detects abnormal activity on a candidate\u2019s feed, it issues an alert to a human proctor, who can then verify whether or not there has been a breach in testing regulations. This additional layer of oversight provides added security and allows thousands of candidates to be monitored with additional security protections.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Is Generative AI a Blessing or a Curse?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the upskilling and reskilling revolution progress, it has never been more important to secure tests against novel cheating methods. From deepfakes disguising test-taking proxies to the use of LLMs to provide answers to test questions, the threats are real and accessible. But so are the solutions.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, as GenAI continues to advance, test security services are meeting the challenge, staying at the cutting edge of an AI arms race against bad actors. By employing innovative ways to detect cheating using GenAI, from <a href=\"https://kryterion.my.site.com/support/s/article/Online-Proctored-Dual-Camera-Requirement?language=en_US\">dual-camera proctoring</a> to AI-enhanced monitoring, test security firms can effectively counter these threats.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These methods provide firms with the peace of mind that training programs are reliable and that certifications and licenses are veritable. By doing so, they can foster professional growth for their employees and enable them to excel in new positions.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, the nature of AI means that the threats to test security are dynamic and ever-evolving. Therefore, as GenAI improves and poses new threats to test integrity, it is crucial that security firms continue to invest in harnessing it to develop and refine innovative, multi-layered security strategies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with any new technology, people will try to wield AI for both bad and good ends. But by leveraging the technology for good, we can ensure certifications remain reliable and meaningful and that trust in the workforce and its capabilities remains strong. The future of exam security is not just about keeping up \u2013 it is about staying ahead.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/is-generative-ai-a-blessing-or-a-curse-tackling-ai-threats-in-exam-security/\">Is Generative AI a Blessing or a Curse?

Once celebrated for its community-driven open-source ethos,\u00a0<a href=\"https://semgrep.dev/index.html\">Semgrep</a>\u00a0ignited controversy when it altered its licensing model in December 2024. These licensing changes restricted the use of contributed rules in commercial products and shifted key features behind a paywall.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Semgrep became an essential tool for developers worldwide due to its ability to detect vulnerabilities across multiple programming languages. However, the company\u2019s decision risks stifling innovation in an area vital to modern cybersecurity.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amid the controversy, DevSecOps startup DeepSource launched\u00a0<a href=\"https://deepsource.com/changelog/jan-25-2025\">Globstar</a>, a new open-source toolkit for code security. Built from scratch and released under the MIT license, Globstar says it aims to provide unrestricted commercial and full public access to its code.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Through Globstar, we are offering a fresh approach to custom static analysis, designed with the needs of security teams in mind. It emerged from an internal framework we had developed for threat detection,\u201d\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanketsaurav/\">Sanket Saurav</a>, co-founder and CEO of\u00a0<a href=\"https://deepsource.com/\">DeepSource</a>, told me. \u201cSemgrep is already in capable hands, and our goal was to take a distinct path. We see ourselves not as a replacement, but an alternative who brings a new perspective to the space.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company has raised a total of $7.7M in funding and is currently being backed by Y-Combinator investors.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developed utilizing the Go programming language and integrated with Tree-sitter, Globstar supports over 20 programming languages. The toolkit features an intuitive YAML interface for creating custom security checkers and an advanced Go interface for complex, cross-file analysis.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen a project is forked, it often takes a different trajectory\u2014but when constrained to building on top of an existing product, innovation can be limited,\u201d said Sanket. \u201cWe created a system that simplifies the process of writing custom code checkers.\u201d</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Business Necessity Versus Open-Source Preservation</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Dec. 13, 2024, Semgrep revamped its licensing model to restrict third-party use of contributed rules in competing commercial products without authorization. Moreover, the company rebranded its open-source version to &#8220;Semgrep CE&#8221; (Community Edition). Semgrep claims that its licensing changes are essential to protect intellectual property and ensure sustainable revenue. The company contends that restricting commercial use helps curb unauthorized repackaging and supports long-term innovation.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen engineers write code to solve a problem, static analysis examines the code without execution, identifying patterns and potential issues early in the development process. Semgrep is a respected player in this space, and I hold them in high regard,\u201d said Sanket. \u201cHowever, their shift in licensing for commercial users reflects a broader reality: VC-backed companies must balance open-source principles with sustainable business models.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He notes that while the change didn\u2019t directly impact end users, it raises an ongoing debate about whether open source should remain entirely unrestricted or evolve to ensure long-term viability.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On January 2025, 10 DevSec firms including Aikido Security, Arnica, Amplify Security, Endor Labs, Jit, Kodem, Legit Security, Mobb and Orca Security\u2014formed a consortium to launch Opengrep. Traditionally fierce competitors, the new consortium directly plans to challenge Semgrep\u2019s decision to limit functionality in favor of commercial gain. In a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.endorlabs.com/learn/everything-you-need-to-know-about-opengrep\">blog post</a>, Endor Labs stated that static code analysis is \u201ctoo important to restrict\u201d.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it's not yet clear if Opengrep merely repackages legacy code rather than offering a completely new solution.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The Rise of Open-Source Alternatives\u00a0</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeepSource recognized a growing need among developers for a tool that does not inherit legacy constraints. \u201cEnterprise customers don\u2019t want to juggle multiple tools\u2014it creates integration challenges and drives demand for an all-in-one solution,\u201d explained Sanket. \u201cStatic analysis plays a crucial role in understanding code architecture, which is why we\u2019ve positioned ourselves as a unified platform.\u201d</p>\n<p>However, DeepSource\u2019s Globstar is not alone, several static code analysis alternatives have gained traction following the Semgrep licensing controversy. For instance, SonarQube is a code analysis platform that offers both a free Community Edition and paid versions, for static code analysis, integration support and metrics tracking. Likewise, ShellCheck is another alternative specifically used for analyzing shell scripts, and aids developers in catching scripting errors that could later lead to major bugs or inefficiencies. It flags commands or syntax that may not be portable across different shell environments. Due to its ease of use\u2014ability to run from the command line and easily integrate into CI/CD pipelines, ShellCheck has become an increasingly popular choice.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Opengrep seeks to preserve a legacy tool\u2019s open roots, other alternatives like SonarQube, Globstar and ShellCheck also offer a fresh, forward-thinking solution. As the open-source debate unfolds, developers and enterprises face pivotal choices that may redefine the landscape of code analysis.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/open-source-alternatives-amid-semgrep-licensing-controversy/\">Open-Source Alternatives Amid Semgrep Licensing Controversy</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai\">Unite.AI</a>.</p>"

Announced last week, the update introduces a Responses API, an open-source Agents SDK, and built-in tools for web search, file search, and computer control \u2013 all designed to streamline how AI systems interact with real-world information and applications\u200b.</p>\n<p>OpenAI describes these agents as \u201csystems that independently accomplish tasks on behalf of users\u201d\u200b, meaning they can carry out multi-step processes \u2013 like researching a topic or updating a database \u2013 with minimal human guidance. The company\u2019s goal is to lower the barrier for developers and businesses to deploy powerful AI-driven assistants, thereby expanding accessibility to advanced AI capabilities.</p>\n<h2><b>Responses API: Simplifying Agent Interactions</b></h2>\n<p>At the heart of OpenAI\u2019s announcement is the new Responses API, which serves as a unified interface for building AI agents. This API <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions\">combines the conversational abilities of OpenAI\u2019s Chat Completions API</a> with the tool-using functionality of its previous Assistants API\u200b. In practical terms, this means a single API call can now handle complex, multi-step tasks that might involve calling on various tools or knowledge sources.</p>\n<p>OpenAI says the Responses API was built to simplify agent development by reducing the need for custom code and prompt tinkering. <i>\u201cThe Responses API is designed for developers who want to easily combine OpenAI models and built-in tools into their apps, without the complexity of integrating multiple APIs or external vendors,\u201d</i> the company explained in its announcement blog post\u200b. Previously, developers often had to orchestrate multiple API calls and craft elaborate prompts to get an AI agent to do something useful, which was challenging and time-consuming\u200b. With the new API, an agent can, for example, hold a conversation with a user, lookup information via web search, then write a summary \u2013 all within one workflow.</p>\n<p>Notably, the Responses API is available to all developers at no extra cost beyond standard usage fees\u200b. It is also backward-compatible: OpenAI confirmed it will continue supporting its popular Chat Completions API for simple use-cases, while the older Assistants API will be phased out by mid-2026 as its features are folded into the Responses API\u200b.</p>\n<h2><b>Open-Source Agents SDK Streamlines Workflow Orchestration</b></h2>\n<p>The launch also includes the Agents SDK, a toolkit for managing the workflows of one or even multiple interacting AI agents. In a notable move, OpenAI has made this SDK open source, allowing developers and enterprises to inspect the code and even integrate non-OpenAI models into their agent systems\u200b.\u00a0This flexibility means a company could coordinate an agent that uses OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 alongside another agent powered by a different AI model, all within the same framework.</p>\n<p>The Agents SDK is focused on workflow orchestration \u2013 essentially, keeping track of what an agent is doing and how it hands off tasks. It provides built-in mechanisms for things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Configurable agents:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> setting up AI agents with predefined roles or instructions for specific tasks\u200b.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Intelligent handoffs:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> passing tasks between multiple agents or processes based on context (for instance, one agent gathering data, then another agent analyzing it)\u200b.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Guardrails for safety:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ensuring the agent stays within certain bounds, with input validation and content moderation tools to prevent unwanted outputs.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Tracing and observability:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tools to monitor and debug an agent\u2019s actions step-by-step, which helps developers understand decisions and improve performance\u200b.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to OpenAI, this toolkit can simplify complex use cases such as customer support bots, multi-step research assistants, content generation workflows, code review agents, or sales prospecting automation\u200b. By open-sourcing the SDK, OpenAI is also encouraging community contributions and adoption in enterprise settings, where transparency and the ability to self-host components are often important. Early adopters including companies like <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/pt-br/developer-platform/discover/launches/openai-agents-sdk\">Coinbase</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.box.com/box-announces-support-new-openai-agents-sdk-make-enterprise-content-smarter\">Box</a> have already experimented with the Agents SDK to build <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/googles-ai-co-scientist-vs-openais-deep-research-vs-perplexitys-deep-research-a-comparison-of-ai-research-agents/\">AI-powered research</a> and data extraction tools\u200b.</span></p>\n<a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/developer-barriers-lowered-as-openai-simplifies-ai-agent-creation/\"><img alt=\"YouTube Video\" src=\"https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FhciNKcLwSes%2Fhqdefault.jpg\" /></a><br /><br /></p>\n<h2><strong>Built-In Tools Enhance AI Functionality</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make AI agents more functional out-of-the-box, OpenAI\u2019s Responses API comes with three built-in tools that connect the AI to outside data and actions. These tools significantly expand what an agent can do, moving beyond just generating text.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong>The built-in tools available at launch are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Web Search:</strong> Allows an AI agent to perform real-time web searches and retrieve up-to-date information, complete with cited sources. This means an agent can answer questions using the latest news or facts from the internet, and provide the references for transparency. This tool is useful for building agents like research assistants, shopping guides, or travel planners that need live information\u200b.<br />\n</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>File Search:</strong> Lets an agent quickly sift through large collections of documents or data that a developer has provided, in order to find relevant information\u200b.This is essentially a private knowledge base query tool \u2013 an agent could use it to answer customer support questions by looking up policy documents, or assist in legal research by retrieving passages from a library of files. This tool can be deployed in scenarios like customer service bots or internal company assistants that need to reference proprietary information\u200b.</span></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Computer Use:</strong> A new capability (currently in research preview) that allows an AI agent to perform actions on a computer as if it were a human user operating the machine\u200b. Powered by OpenAI\u2019s computer-using agent (CUA) model, this tool translates the AI\u2019s intentions into keyboard and mouse actions to navigate software, websites, or other digital interfaces\u200b. In essence, it enables automation of tasks that don\u2019t have an easy API \u2013 for example, entering data into a legacy system, clicking through a web app for testing, or checking information on a graphical interface.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By integrating these tools, the AI agents can not only think through a problem but also act \u2013 whether that means searching for information, retrieving specific data, or manipulating a digital environment. This greatly extends an agent\u2019s functionality and makes it much more useful for real-world applications.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OpenAI envisions that developers will combine these tools as needed; for example, an agent might use web search to gather public info and file search to pull internal data, then use that combined knowledge to draft a report or execute a task. All of this can be orchestrated through the Responses API in a unified manner, rather than requiring separate services or manual integration.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Broader Implications for AI Adoption and Accessibility</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analysts say this launch could accelerate the adoption of AI agents across industries by lowering technical hurdles. For businesses, the appeal of these new tools is the ability to automate and scale processes without extensive custom development\u200b.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Routine tasks like information retrieval, form processing, or cross-app data entry \u2013 which might have required significant coding or multiple software systems \u2013 can now potentially be handled by AI agents using OpenAI\u2019s building blocks. The built-in search tools, for instance, let companies plug AI into their knowledge databases or the web almost instantly, and the computer-use tool offers a way to interface with legacy applications that don\u2019t have APIs\u200b. Meanwhile, the open-source nature of the Agents SDK gives enterprises more control, allowing them to integrate these AI agents into their existing infrastructure and even use different AI models as needed\u200b.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OpenAI\u2019s move is part of a broader race to empower developers with agent-building capabilities. Competing tech firms and startups have been rolling out their own AI agent platforms, and OpenAI\u2019s comprehensive toolkit may help it stand out. In fact, the timing comes amid a surge of interest in autonomous AI agents globally \u2013 for example, Chinese startup Monica recently grabbed attention with its agent <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/unveiling-manus-ai-chinas-breakthrough-in-fully-autonomous-ai-agents/\">Manus</a>, claiming it could outperform OpenAI\u2019s own prototype agent in certain tasks\u200b. By open-sourcing key parts of its platform and offering built-in tools, OpenAI appears to be responding to competitive pressure while also fostering wider adoption of AI.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From an accessibility standpoint, these tools could democratize who can build advanced AI systems. Smaller companies and even individual developers may now find it feasible to create an AI-driven assistant or workflow without needing a large research team. The integrated approach (where one API call can handle multiple steps) and the availability of examples in OpenAI\u2019s documentation lower the entry barrier for newcomers. OpenAI is also providing an observability interface for developers to trace and inspect what the agent is doing, which is crucial for debugging and building trust in AI outputs\u200b. This focus on usability and safety (with guardrails and monitoring) is expected to encourage more enterprises to experiment with AI agents, knowing they have oversight and control.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI agents could become as common and essential as having an internet presence. OpenAI\u2019s latest tools, by making agent development more approachable, could help turn that vision into reality by enabling a much wider community of developers and organizations to build their own agents.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/developer-barriers-lowered-as-openai-simplifies-ai-agent-creation/\">Developer Barriers Lowered as OpenAI Simplifies AI Agent Creation</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai\">Unite.AI</a>.</p>"

With a deep understanding of global healthcare systems and governance, he has been instrumental in developing innovative solutions that streamline clinical documentation and enhance operational efficiency. His expertise in healthcare integrations has shaped Augnito\u2019s mission to transform how clinicians interact with technology, improving accuracy and workflow automation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://augnito.ai/\">Augnito</a> is a leading provider of Voice AI solutions for Clinical Documentation and Ambient Clinical Intelligence, serving more than 500 hospitals and 15,000 clinicians worldwide. Its SaaS solutions enhance workflow automation, ensure accuracy in administrative tasks, and equip clinicians with real-time, evidence-based recommendations and insights.</p>\n<p><strong>You started your first company at the age of 19. How did your experience in clinical transcription with the NHS shape your vision for Augnito?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>My journey in healthcare technology began when I co-founded Scribetech in the UK at 19 years old. This early venture became a pioneer in clinical transcription services for the National Health Service (NHS), laying the critical foundation for what would eventually become Augnito.</p>\n<p>Working with the NHS provided invaluable insights into healthcare documentation challenges on a massive scale. We were selected as a leading supplier on three consecutive national framework contracts, each lasting about five years, giving us the rare opportunity to work with the world's largest single healthcare organization. Our longstanding relationships with prestigious institutions like Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, University Hospital Birmingham, and Kingston University Trust taught us the intricacies of clinical workflows across diverse specialties.</p>\n<p>Those nearly two decades of experience revealed a fundamental truth: documentation was consuming an unsustainable amount of clinicians' time. We witnessed firsthand how this administrative burden impacted patient care quality and provider satisfaction.\u00a0 This realization ultimately shaped Augnito's core mission\u2014to create technology that liberates healthcare professionals from documentation burdens while maintaining the highest standards of accuracy and compliance.</p>\n<p>The NHS experience also instilled in us a deep appreciation for the importance of data security, interoperability, and scalable solutions that could work across different healthcare environments. These principles remain central to Augnito's development philosophy today.</p>\n<p><strong>Augnito was born out of a pivot from transcription services to AI-driven voice solutions. What were the key factors that led to this strategic shift?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>This strategic pivot emerged from several converging factors. First, about nine years ago, we observed our BPO revenue growth flattening due to increasing automation demands across the healthcare industry. Rather than resist this inevitable transition, we decided to disrupt our own business model by investing profits into developing what would become Augnito.</p>\n<p>A critical insight drove this decision: we discovered that doctors worldwide spend approximately 50% of their working hours on record-keeping, while nurses spend around 30% on similar tasks. This represented an enormous inefficiency in healthcare delivery\u2014valuable time that could be redirected toward patient care.</p>\n<p>The technological landscape was also evolving rapidly. Cloud computing, advanced AI algorithms, and improved speech recognition capabilities created new possibilities that weren\u2019t available when we started Scribetech. We recognized an opportunity to leverage these technologies to address the acute pain point of inefficient clinical documentation and interoperability challenges.</p>\n<p>What began as an efficiency tool for our transcription business evolved into a comprehensive solution that could transform clinical workflows entirely. The shift from transcription services to AI-driven voice solutions represented not just a technological upgrade but a fundamental reimagining of how clinical documentation could work\u2014 emphasizing speed, accuracy, and seamless integration with existing healthcare systems.</p>\n<p><strong>What have been some of the biggest challenges in scaling Augnito from an\u00a0 India-based startup to a globally recognized AI company?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Scaling Augnito globally presented several significant challenges. First and foremost was ensuring data interoperability across vastly different healthcare systems.\u00a0 Healthcare infrastructure varies dramatically worldwide, with each country maintaining unique regulatory frameworks and documentation standards. Building technology that could integrate seamlessly with these diverse systems required extensive research and development.</p>\n<p>Another major hurdle was gaining trust from healthcare professionals. Medicine is understandably conservative when adopting new technologies, especially AI solutions that handle sensitive patient information. Overcoming this skepticism demanded not just technical excellence but also a commitment to building relationships and demonstrating consistent value.</p>\n<p>Technical challenges were equally demanding. The diversity of speech patterns, accents, and medical terminologies across regions required sophisticated language models. In India alone, we faced the complexity of numerous regional accents and native languages that needed accurate interpretation in a medical context. This challenge was compounded by the high stakes of healthcare documentation, where even small errors can have serious consequences.</p>\n<p>Additionally, helping clinicians transition from legacy systems to AI-powered solutions required careful change management. Many healthcare professionals were accustomed to traditional documentation methods, and facilitating this transition meant creating intuitive interfaces and providing comprehensive support systems.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most persistent challenge has been balancing innovation with practical implementation. While developing cutting-edge AI capabilities, we've had to ensure our solutions remain accessible, affordable, and immediately valuable to healthcare providers across different economic contexts and resource settings.</p>\n<p><strong>How does Augnito tailor its AI solutions to different healthcare systems,\u00a0 given the diverse regulatory and operational environments across\u00a0 countries?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Augnito approaches this challenge through flexibility in both design and deployment.\u00a0 We've created solutions that can be implemented as cloud-based SaaS or on-premises installations, depending on regulatory requirements and institutional preferences.

Clinicians can upload predefined templates for various clinical note types and control everything through intuitive voice commands, eliminating repetitive typing tasks.</p>\n<p>Omni AI Scribe takes this further by allowing physicians to focus entirely on their patients during consultations while AI handles documentation automatically. This enables doctors to maintain eye contact and engage more meaningfully with patients instead of dividing attention between the patient and the computer screen.</p>\n<p>Beyond time savings, our solutions improve documentation quality and reduce claim rejections. This eliminates the administrative headaches associated with resubmitting claims or correcting documentation errors\u2014another source of professional frustration.</p>\n<p>The ROI extends beyond clinical satisfaction. Organizations using our solutions have achieved a 21-fold return on investment within just six months, demonstrating that addressing burnout through AI-powered documentation also makes financial sense for healthcare institutions.</p>\n<p><strong>What role does Augnito\u2019s AI play in enhancing doctor-patient interactions\u00a0 rather than replacing human decision-making?</strong></p>\n<p>I have always maintained that Augnito's solutions are designed to augment and empower clinicians, not replace their expertise whatsoever. Our technology operates on the principle that transformative healthcare technology should function silently in\u00a0 the background, enhancing care without intrusion.</p>\n<p>The most immediate impact on doctor-patient interactions comes from liberating clinicians from documentation burdens during consultations. With Omni AI Scribe, doctors can maintain eye contact and engage more meaningfully with patients instead of typing notes during the encounter. This restores the sanctity of patient-provider interactions\u2014a nurse can simultaneously monitor a critical case and verbally update records hands-free, exemplifying technology that serves rather than disrupts.</p>\n<p>We recognize that while AI excels at processing vast amounts of data and identifying patterns, the human elements of healthcare\u2014empathy, intuitive understanding, and complex decision-making\u2014remain irreplaceable. Our AI functions as a sophisticated tool in a physician's arsenal, much like how the stethoscope revolutionized medicine in its time.</p>\n<p>The future we envision is one of seamless collaboration between AI and healthcare professionals. While our AI can transcribe and structure patient conversations, analyze patterns, and suggest potential diagnoses, it's the physician who contextualizes this information, makes final decisions, and provides the human connection that patients need.</p>\n<p>By handling routine administrative tasks, our technology allows clinicians to focus on their core competencies\u2014diagnosing conditions, developing treatment plans, and building therapeutic relationships with patients. In fact, physicians using our solutions potentially have time to see additional patients or spend more quality time with each patient.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, our goal is to create technology that makes healthcare more efficient, accurate, and human-centered\u2014enhancing rather than replacing the human intelligence and compassion at the heart of medicine.</p>\n<p><strong>How does Augnito integrate with existing healthcare infrastructure like EMRs, and what are the biggest interoperability challenges you\u2019ve faced?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Augnito has designed its integration approach with flexibility and ease of implementation as core principles.

This forward-looking approach ensures our solutions evolve alongside healthcare needs and technological capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>There\u2019s growing debate about the role of AI in medicine. How do you see AI evolving in healthcare over the next 5-10 years?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>I believe we're at the threshold of a profound transformation in healthcare, with AI evolving from isolated applications to comprehensive ecosystems that impact every aspect of medicine. The global healthcare AI market is projected to reach $188 billion by 2030, reflecting this extraordinary growth trajectory.</p>\n<p>In the near term, we'll see AI revolutionizing diagnostic capabilities, with systems becoming increasingly sophisticated in analyzing medical images and detecting conditions earlier. By 2025, Gartner predicts that 30% of new drugs will be discovered using generative AI, slashing the traditional 10\u201315-year drug development timeline. The\u00a0global GenAI healthcare market specifically is projected to grow from $1.96 billion in 2024 to $39.68 billion by 2034\u2014a remarkable 35.1% CAGR.</p>\n<p>I anticipate a fundamental shift in how AI is perceived within healthcare organizations.\u00a0 Rather than viewing AI solutions as software products, institutions will increasingly see them as &#8220;AI staff\u201d essential team members that handle specific functions alongside human professionals. This perspective shift is significant because it means AI will disrupt not just the enterprise software market (valued in tens of billions) but the services market (valued in trillions).</p>\n<p>The next evolution will be toward agentic AI\u2014systems capable of proactive, goal-oriented reasoning with contextual continuity, predictive agency, and appropriate ethical boundaries. In chronic care management, for example, agentic AI integrated with wearable devices could provide personalized voice check-ins analyzing glucose trends, dietary patterns, and exercise motivation levels.</p>\n<p>Healthcare organizations are already prioritizing AI implementation, with 45% of healthcare operations leaders considering it a top priority for boosting efficiency. This momentum will accelerate as AI demonstrates tangible benefits like 30% shorter hospital stays, 60% higher patient satisfaction, and billions in cost savings.</p>\n<p>The ultimate evolution, however, won't be measured in market size but in transformed human connections: clinicians freed to heal, patients empowered to thrive, and technology that silently elevates both. The most successful AI implementations will balance efficiency with empathy, creating healthcare systems that are not just technologically advanced but fundamentally more humane.</p>\n<p><em>Thank you for the great interview, readers who wish to learn more should visit <a href=\"https://augnito.ai/\">Augnito</a>.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/rustom-lawyer-co-founder-ceo-of-augnito-interview-series/\">Rustom Lawyer, Co-Founder &#038; CEO of Augnito &#8211; Interview Series</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai\">Unite.AI</a>.</p>"

Yet, when asked about their primary concerns during the selection process, 60.3% voted privacy and security as their biggest worries. This emphasis on ease of use, however, raises questions about whether security is being adequately prioritized.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is becoming easier for humans and machines to communicate, enabling AI users to accomplish more with greater proficiency. Businesses can automate tasks, optimize processes, and make better decisions with user-friendly analytics.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">API-driven AI and microservices will allow businesses to integrate advanced AI functions into their existing systems in a modular fashion. Pair this with no-code solutions, auto-ML, and voice-controlled multimodal virtual assistants and this approach will speed up the development of custom applications without requiring extensive AI expertise.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through continued exploration and optimization, AI is projected to add </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/08/07/harnessing-generative-ai-a-44-trillion-opportunity-for-the-global-economy/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USD 4.4 trillion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the global economy. The crucial and complex part to keep in mind today is verifying that these pre-built solutions comply with regulatory and ethical AI practices. Strong encryption, tight access control, and regular checks keep data safe in these AI systems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also worth checking what ethical AI frameworks providers follow to build trust, avoid harm, and ensure AI benefits everyone. Some noted ones include, the </span><a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/698792/EPRS_BRI(2021)698792_EN.pdf#:~:text=The%20AI%20act%2C%20the%20first%20binding%20worldwide%20horizontal,requirements%20and%20obligations%20tailored%20to%20a%20%27risk-based%20approach.%27\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EU AI Act</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, OECD AI Principles, UNESCO AI Ethics Framework, IEEE Ethically Aligned Design (EAD) Guidelines, and </span><a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NIST AI Risk Management Framework</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2>What Do Leaders Need, and Where Do They Go To Get It?</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although data privacy concerns were leaders\u2019 biggest worries during the AI selection phase, when asked about their integration challenges, only 20.6% ranked it as a primary issue. Instead, 41.2% of leaders stated that costs of integration were top of mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interestingly, however, when asked \u201cWhat additional support do you need?\u201d the response &#8220;More affordable options&#8221; was ranked the lowest, with leaders more focused on finding training and education (56.6%), customized solutions (54.4%), and technical support (54.4%). This suggests that people aren't just going after the cheapest options\u2014they are looking for providers that can support them with integration and security. They would prefer to find trusted partners to guide them through proper data privacy protection methods and are willing to pay for it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">External information sources are the go-to when researching which AI applications leaders can trust. When asked to choose between social networking platforms, blogs, community platforms, and online directories as their most trusted source of information when deciding on tools, an equal majority of 54.4% said LinkedIn and X.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is likely that these two platforms were most trusted due to the vast amount of professionals available to connect with. On LinkedIn, leaders can follow company pages, best practices, product information, and interests shared via posts, review peers' comments, and even open conversations with other peers to gain insights from firsthand experiences. Similarly, on X, leaders can follow industry experts, analysts, and companies to stay informed about the latest developments. The platform's fast-paced nature means if an AI tool is trending, platform members will hear about it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, the potential for misinformation and biased opinions exists on any social media platform. Decision-makers must be mindful to consider a combination of online research, expert consultations, and vendor demonstrations when making AI tool purchasing decisions.</span></p>\n<h2>Can Leadership Evolve Fast Enough?</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limited internal expertise to manage AI was listed by 26.5% as their second biggest concern during integration, second only to integration costs. A </span><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/uk-en/championing-female-leadership-in-the-age-of-ai-2/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent IBM study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on AI in the workplace found that 87% of business leaders expect at least a quarter of their workforce will need to reskill in response to generative AI and automation. While finding the right partner is a good start, what strategies can leaders use to train teams on the required information and achieve successful adoption?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slow and steady wins the race, but aim to make every minute count. Business leaders must realize regulatory compliance and prepare their operations and workforce. This involves creating effective AI governance strategies built upon five pillars: explainability, fairness, robustness, transparency, and privacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps when everyone is on the same page\u2014with employees who share your eagerness to adopt more efficient strategies. Start by showing them what's in it for them. Higher profits? Less stressful workloads? Opportunities to learn and advance? It helps to have evidence to back up your statements. Be prepared to deliver some quick wins or pilot projects that solve more simple pain points. For example, in a healthcare scenario, this could be transcribing patient calls and auto-filling intake forms for doctors' approval.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, you cannot predict what is on everyone's minds, so it's important to create spaces where teams feel comfortable sharing ideas, concerns, and feedback without fear of judgment or reprisal. This also offers the chance to discover and solve pain points you didn't know existed. Fostering psychological safety is also crucial when adjusting to new processes. Frame failures as valuable learning experiences, not setbacks, to help encourage forward momentum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adopting AI in business isn't just about efficiency gains\u2014it\u2019s about striking the right balance between usability, security, and trust. While companies recognize AI\u2019s potential to reduce costs and streamline operations, they face real challenges, including integration expenses, and a growing need for AI-specific skills. Employees worry about job displacement, and leadership must proactively address these fears through transparency and upskilling initiatives. Robust AI governance is critical to navigating compliance, ethical considerations, and data protection. Ultimately, making AI work in the real world comes down to clear communication, tangible benefits, and a security-first culture that encourages experimentation.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai/new-survey-finds-balancing-ais-ease-of-use-with-trust-is-top-of-business-leaders-minds/\">New Survey Finds Balancing AI\u2019s Ease of Use with Trust is Top of Business Leaders Minds</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.unite.ai\">Unite.AI</a>.</p>"

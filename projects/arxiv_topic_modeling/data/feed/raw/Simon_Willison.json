The term <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383\">was coined by Andrej Karpathy</a> just a few weeks ago (on February 6th) and has since been featured <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/technology/personaltech/vibecoding-ai-software-programming.html\">in the New York Times</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/\">Ars Technica</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/16/ai-software-coding-programmer-expertise-jobs-threat\">the Guardian</a> and countless online discussions.</p>\n<p>I'm concerned that the definition is already escaping its original intent.

Think about how much harm the code you are writing could cause if it has bugs or security vulnerabilities. Could somebody be harmed - damaged reputation, lost money or something worse? This is particularly important if you plan to build software that will be used by other people!</li>\n<li>Consider <strong>security</strong>. This is a really difficult one - security is a huge topic. Some high level notes:\n<ul>\n<li>Watch out for <strong>secrets</strong> - anything that looks similar in shape to a password, such as the API key used to access an online tool. If your code involves secrets you need to take care not to accidentally expose them, which means you need to understand how the code works!</li>\n<li>Think about <strong>data privacy</strong>. If you are building a tool that has access to private data - anything you wouldn't want to display to the world in a screen-sharing session - approach with caution. It's possible to vibe code personal tools that you paste private information into but you need to be very sure you understand if there are ways that data might leave your machine.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Be a <strong>good network citizen</strong>. Anything that makes requests out to other platforms could increase the load (and hence the cost) on those services. This is a reason I like <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts/\">Claude Artifacts</a> - their sandbox prevents accidents from causing harm elsewhere.</li>\n<li>Is <strong>your money on the line</strong>? I've seen horror stories about people who vibe coded a feature against some API without a billing limit and racked up thousands of dollars in charges. Be very careful about using vibe coding against anything that's charged based on usage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're going to vibe code anything that might be used by other people, I recommend checking in with someone more experienced for a vibe check (hah) before you share it with the world.</p>\n<h4 id=\"how-do-we-make-vibe-coding-better-\">How do we make vibe coding better?</h4>\n<p>I think there are some fascinating software design challenges to be solved here.</p>\n<p>Safe vibe coding for complete beginners starts with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)\">sandbox</a>. Claude Artifacts was one of the first widely available vibe coding platforms and their approach to sandboxing is fantastic: code is restricted to running in a locked down <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, can load only approved libraries and can't make any network requests to other sites.</p>\n<p>This makes it very difficult for people to mess up and cause any harm with their projects. It also greatly limits what those projects can do - you can't use a Claude Artifact project to access data from external APIs for example, or even to build software that runs your own prompts against an LLM.</p>\n<p>Other popular vibe coding tools like Cursor (which was initially intended for professional developers) have far less safety rails.</p>\n<p>There's plenty of room for innovation in this space. I'm hoping to see a cambrian explosion in tooling to help people build their own custom tools as productively and safely as possible.</p>\n<h4 id=\"go-forth-and-vibe-code\">Go forth and vibe code</h4>\n<p>I really don't want to discourage people who are new to software from trying out vibe coding.

I've been trying it out using <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/\">LLM</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama\">llm-ollama</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>llm install llm-ollama\nllm -m gemma3:27b 'Build a single page HTML+CSS+JavaScript UI that gives me a large textarea for writing in which constantly saves what I have entered to localStorage (restoring when I reload the page) and displays a word counter'\n</code></pre>\n<p>That was a replay of <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#word-counter.html\">a prompt</a> I ran against Claude Artifacts a few months ago. Here's <a href=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemma3-word-count.html\">what Gemma built</a>, and the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/f8a87f2242439d3974405a17f5d8bc23\">full chat transcript</a>. It's a simple example but it worked just right.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Animated demo - a simple textarea, I type text in it and a word count updates above.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemma-word-count.gif\" /></p>\n\n<p>Let's try out the vision mode, by asking it to describe this photo:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Two pelicans flying against a blue sky \" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg\" /></p>\n<pre><code>llm -m gemma3:27b describe -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/0e703ba72d0cf5a6dd117981bd03e604\">the full response</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong></p>\n<p>The image features two brown pelicans in flight against a solid, bright blue background. The composition is dynamic, capturing the birds mid-wingbeat.</p>\n<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Pelicans:</strong> Both pelicans are a rich, dark brown color. They have large, pale yellow-orange beaks and pouches. One pelican is shown with its wings fully extended, appearing to be gliding or soaring. The other is captured with its wings in a more dynamic, upward-sweeping motion.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Background:</strong> The background is a flat, uniform shade of bright blue, which makes the pelicans stand out.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Composition:</strong> The birds are positioned in opposite directions, creating a sense of movement and balance. The image is well-lit, highlighting the texture of the pelicans' feathers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Overall, the image is a striking and visually appealing depiction of these majestic birds in flight.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is it right to say \"the birds are positioned in opposite directions\"? I thought that was a mistake at first, but I'll give it a pass since their wings are positioned in opposite directions to each other.</p>\n\n<p>Something I've been curious about recently is longer context support: how well can a local model on my laptop deal with summarization or data extraction tasks against longer pieces of text?</p>\n<p>I decided to try <a href=\"https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes#user-content-adding-a--m-model-option\">my Hacker News summarize script</a> using Gemma, against <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43340491\">the thread</a> there discussing the Gemma 3 technical paper.</p>\n<p>First I did a quick token count (using the OpenAI tokenizer but it's usually a similar number to other models):</p>\n<pre><code>curl 'https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/items/43340491' | ttok\n</code></pre>\n<p>This returned 22,260 - well within Gemma's documented limits but still a healthy number considering just last year most models topped out at 4,000 or 8,000.</p>\n<p>I ran my script like this:</p>\n<pre><code>hn-summary.sh 43340491 -m gemma3:27b\n</code></pre>\n<p>It did a pretty good job!

The composition is dynamic, capturing the birds mid-wingbeat.</p>\n<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Pelicans:</strong> Both pelicans are a rich, dark brown color. They have large, pale yellow-orange beaks and pouches. One pelican is shown with its wings fully extended, appearing to be gliding or soaring. The other is captured with its wings in a more dynamic, upward-sweeping motion.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Background:</strong> The background is a flat, uniform shade of bright blue, which makes the pelicans stand out.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Composition:</strong> The birds are positioned in opposite directions, creating a sense of movement and balance.

They may well have stumbled on to patterns that work, but those patterns do not come naturally to everyone.</p>\n<p>I've been getting great results out of LLMs for code for over two years now.

All they do is predict a sequence of tokens - but it turns out writing code is mostly about stringing tokens together in the right order, so they can be <em>extremely</em> useful for this provided you point them in the right direction.</p>\n<p>If you assume that this technology will implement your project perfectly without you needing to exercise any of your own skill you'll quickly be disappointed.</p>\n<p>Instead, use them to <em>augment</em> your abilities. My current favorite mental model is to think of them as an over-confident pair programming assistant who's lightning fast at looking things up, can churn out relevant examples at a moment's notice and can execute on tedious tasks without complaint.</p>\n<p><strong>Over-confident</strong> is important. They'll absolutely make mistakes - sometimes subtle, sometimes huge. These mistakes can be <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/kellan-elliott-mccrea/\">deeply inhuman</a> - if a human collaborator hallucinated a non-existent library or method you would instantly lose trust in them. Don't fall into the trap of anthropomorphizing LLMs and assuming that failures which would discredit a human should discredit the machine in the same way.</p>\n<p>When working with LLMs you'll often find things that they just cannot do. Make a note of these - they are useful lessons! They're also valuable examples to stash away for the future - a sign of a strong new model is when it produces usable results for a task that previous models had been unable to handle.</p>\n<h4 id=\"account-for-training-cut-off-dates\">Account for training cut-off dates</h4>\n<p>A crucial characteristic of any model is its <strong>training cut-off date</strong>. This is the date at which the data they were trained on stopped being collected. For OpenAI's models this is usually October of 2023. Anthropic and Gemini and other providers may have more recent dates.</p>\n<p>This is <em>extremely</em> important for code, because it influences what libraries they will be familiar with. If the library you are using had a major breaking change since October 2023, OpenAI models won't know about it!</p>\n<p>I gain enough value from LLMs that I now deliberately consider this when picking a library - I try to stick with libraries with good stability and that are popular enough that many examples of them will have made it into the training data. I like applying the principles of <a href=\"https://boringtechnology.club/\">boring technology</a> - innovate on your project's unique selling points, stick with tried and tested solutions for everything else.</p>\n<p>LLMs can still help you work with libraries that exist outside their training data, but you need to put in more work - you'll need to feed them recent examples of how those libraries should be used as part of your prompt.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the most important thing to understand when working with LLMs:</p>\n<h4 id=\"context-is-king\">Context is king</h4>\n<p>Most of the craft of getting good results out of an LLM comes down to managing its context - the text that is part of your current conversation.</p>\n<p>This context isn't just the prompt that you have fed it: successful LLM interactions usually take the form of conversations, and the context consists of every message from you <em>and</em> every reply from the LLM that exist in the current conversation thread.</p>\n<p>When you start a new conversation you reset that context back to zero. This is important to know, as often the fix for a conversation that has stopped being useful is to wipe the slate clean and start again.</p>\n<p>Some LLM coding tools go beyond just the conversation. Claude Projects for example allow you to pre-populate the context with quite a large amount of text - including a recent ability to <a href=\"https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10167454-using-the-github-integration\">import code directly from a GitHub</a> repository which I'm using a <em>lot</em>.</p>\n<p>Tools like Cursor and VS Code Copilot include context from your current editor session and file layout automatically, and you can sometimes use mechanisms like <a href=\"https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/overview\">Cursor's @commands</a> to pull in additional files or documentation.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons I mostly work directly with the <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\">ChatGPT</a> and <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\">Claude</a> web or app interfaces is that it makes it easier for me to understand exactly what is going into the context. LLM tools that obscure that context from me are <em>less</em> effective.</p>\n<p>You can use the fact that previous replies are also part of the context to your advantage. For complex coding tasks try getting the LLM to write a simpler version first, check that it works and then iterate on building to the more sophisticated implementation.</p>\n<p>I often start a new chat by dumping in existing code to seed that context, then work with the LLM to modify it in some way.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite code prompting techniques is to drop in several full examples relating to something I want to build, then prompt the LLM to use them as inspiration for a new project. I wrote about that in detail when I <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/\">described my JavaScript OCR application</a> that combines Tesseract.js and PDF.js - two libraries I had used in the past and for which I could provide working examples in the prompt.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ask-them-for-options\">Ask them for options</h4>\n<p>Most of my projects start with some open questions: is the thing I'm trying to do possible? What are the potential ways I could implement it? Which of those options are the <em>best</em>?</p>\n<p>I use LLMs as part of this initial research phase.</p>\n<p>I'll use prompts like \"what are options for HTTP libraries in Rust? Include usage examples\" - or \"what are some useful drag-and-drop libraries in JavaScript? Build me an artifact demonstrating each one\" (to Claude).</p>\n<p>The training cut-off is relevant here, since it means newer libraries won't be suggested. Usually that's OK - I don't want the latest, I want the most stable and the one that has been around for long enough for the bugs to be ironed out.</p>\n<p>If I'm going to use something more recent I'll do that research myself, outside of LLM world.</p>\n<p>The best way to start any project is with a prototype that proves that the key requirements of that project can be met. I often find that an LLM can get me to that working prototype within a few minutes of me sitting down with my laptop - or sometimes even while working on my phone.</p>\n<h4 id=\"tell-them-exactly-what-to-do\">Tell them exactly what to do</h4>\n<p>Once I've completed the initial research I change modes dramatically. For production code my LLM usage is much more authoritarian: I treat it like a digital intern, hired to type code for me based on my detailed instructions.</p>\n<p>Here's a recent example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Write a Python function that uses asyncio httpx with this signature:</p>\n<pre><code>async def download_db(url, max_size_bytes=5 * 1025 * 1025): -&gt; pathlib.Path\n</code></pre>\n<p>Given a URL, this downloads the database to a temp directory and returns a path to it. BUT it checks the content length header at the start of streaming back that data and, if it's more than the limit, raises an error. When the download finishes it uses <code>sqlite3.connect(...)</code> and then runs a <code>PRAGMA quick_check</code> to confirm the SQLite data is valid - raising an error if not. Finally, if the content length header lies to us -  if it says 2MB but we download 3MB - we get an error raised as soon as we notice that problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I could write this function myself, but it would take me the better part of fifteen minutes to look up all of the details and get the code working right. Claude knocked it out <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/5aed8bd87016c77465c23e0dc4563ec9\">in 15 seconds</a>.</p>\n<p>I find LLMs respond extremely well to function signatures like the one I use here. I get to act as the function designer, the LLM does the work of building the body to my specification.</p>\n<p>I'll often follow-up with \"Now write me the tests using pytest\". Again, I dictate my technology of choice - I want the LLM to save me the time of having to type out the code that's sitting in my head already.</p>\n<p>If your reaction to this is \"surely typing out the code is faster than typing out an English instruction of it\", all I can tell you is that it really isn't for me any more. Code needs to be correct. English has enormous room for shortcuts, and vagaries, and typos, and saying things like \"use that popular HTTP library\" if you can't remember the name off the top of your head.</p>\n<p>The good coding LLMs are excellent at filling in the gaps. They're also much less lazy than me - they'll remember to catch likely exceptions, add accurate docstrings, and annotate code with the relevant types.</p>\n<h4 id=\"you-have-to-test-what-it-writes-\">You have to test what it writes!</h4>\n<p>I wrote about this <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/hallucinations-in-code/#qa\">at length last week</a>: the one thing you absolutely cannot outsource to the machine is testing that the code actually works.</p>\n<p>Your responsibility as a software developer is to deliver working systems. If you haven't seen it run, it's not a working system. You need to invest in strengthening those manual QA habits.</p>\n<p>This may not be glamorous but it's always been a critical part of shipping good code, with or without the involvement of LLMs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"remember-it-s-a-conversation\">Remember it's a conversation</h4>\n<p>If I don't like what an LLM has written, they'll <em>never</em> complain at being told to refactor it! \"Break that repetitive code out into a function\", \"use string manipulation methods rather than a regular expression\", or even \"write that better!\" - the code an LLM produces first time is rarely the final implementation, but they can re-type it dozens of times for you without ever getting frustrated or bored.</p>\n<p>Occasionally I'll get a great result from my first prompt - more frequently the more I practice - but I expect to need at least a few follow-ups.</p>\n<p>I often wonder if this is one of the key tricks that people are missing - a bad initial result isn't a failure, it's a starting point for pushing the model in the direction of the thing you actually want.</p>\n<h4 id=\"use-tools-that-can-run-the-code-for-you\">Use tools that can run the code for you</h4>\n<p>An increasing number of LLM coding tools now have the ability to <em>run that code</em> for you. I'm slightly cautious about some of these since there's a possibility of the wrong command causing real damage, so I tend to stick to the ones that run code in a safe sandbox. My favorites right now are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>ChatGPT Code Interpreter</strong>, where ChatGPT can write and then execute Python code directly in a Kubernetes sandbox VM managed by OpenAI. This is completely safe - it can't even make outbound network connections so really all that can happen is the temporary filesystem gets mangled and then reset.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Claude Artifacts</strong>, where Claude can build you a full HTML+JavaScript+CSS web application that is displayed within the Claude interface. This web app is displayed in a <em>very</em> locked down iframe sandbox, greatly restricting what it can do but preventing problems like accidental exfiltration of your private Claude data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>ChatGPT Canvas</strong> is a newer ChatGPT feature with similar capabilites to Claude Artifacts. I have not explored this enough myself yet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And if you're willing to live a little more dangerously:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.cursor.com/\">Cursor</a></strong> has an \"Agent\" feature that can do this, as does <strong><a href=\"https://codeium.com/windsurf\">Windsurf</a></strong> and a growing number of other editors. I haven't spent enough time with these to make recommendations yet.</li>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://aider.chat/\">Aider</a></strong> is the leading open source implementation of these kinds of patterns, and is a great example of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food\">dogfooding</a> - recent releases of Aider have been <a href=\"https://aider.chat/HISTORY.html\">80%+ written</a> by Aider itself.</li>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview\">Claude Code</a></strong> is Anthropic's new entrant into this space. I'll provide a detailed description of using that tool shortly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This run-the-code-in-a-loop pattern is so powerful that I chose my core LLM tools for coding based primarily on whether they can safely run and iterate on my code.</p>\n<h4 id=\"vibe-coding-is-a-great-way-to-learn\">Vibe-coding is a great way to learn</h4>\n<p>Andrej Karpathy <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/6/andrej-karpathy/\">coined the term</a> vibe-coding just over a month ago, and it has stuck:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There's a new kind of coding I call \"vibe coding\", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. [...] I ask for the dumbest things like \"decrease the padding on the sidebar by half\" because I'm too lazy to find it. I \"Accept All\" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Andrej suggests this is \"not too bad for throwaway weekend projects\". It's also a <em>fantastic</em> way to explore the capabilities of these models - and really fun.</p>\n<p>The best way to learn LLMs is to play with them. Throwing absurd ideas at them and vibe-coding until they almost sort-of work is a genuinely useful way to accelerate the rate at which you build intuition for what works and what doesn't.</p>\n<p>I've been vibe-coding since before Andrej gave it a name! My <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools\">simonw/tools</a> GitHub repository has 77 HTML+JavaScript apps and 6 Python apps, and every single one of them was built by prompting LLMs. I have learned <em>so much</em> from building this collection, and I add to it at a rate of several new prototypes per week.</p>\n<p>You can try most of mine out directly on <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/\">tools.simonwillison.net</a> - a GitHub Pages published version of the repo. I wrote more detailed notes on some of these back in October in <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/\">Everything I built with Claude Artifacts this week</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to see the transcript of the chat used for each one it's almost always linked to in the commit history for that page - or visit the new <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon\">colophon page</a> for an index that includes all of those links.</p>\n<h4 id=\"a-detailed-example\">A detailed example using Claude Code</h4>\n<p>While I was writing this article I had the idea for that <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon\">tools.simonwillison.net/colophon</a> page - I wanted something I could link to that showed the commit history of each of my tools in a more obvious way than GitHub.</p>\n<p>I decided to use that as an opportunity to demonstrate my AI-assisted coding process.</p>\n<p>For this one I used <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview\">Claude Code</a>, because I wanted it to be able to run Python code directly against my existing tools repository on my laptop.</p>\n<p>Running the <code>/cost</code> command at the end of my session showed me this:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; /cost \n  \u23bf  Total cost: $0.61\n     Total duration (API): 5m 31.2s\n     Total duration (wall): 17m 18.7s\n</code></pre>\n<p>The initial project took me just over 17 minutes from start to finish, and cost me 61 cents in API calls to Anthropic.</p>\n<p>I used the authoritarian process where I told the model exactly what I wanted to build. Here's my sequence of prompts (<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/323e1b00ee4f8453c7834a7560eeafc1\">full transcript here</a>).</p>\n<p>I started by asking for an initial script to gather the data needed for the new page:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Almost all of the HTML files in this directory were created using Claude prompts, and the details of those prompts are linked in the commit messages. Build a Python script that checks the commit history for each HTML file in turn and extracts any URLs from those commit messages into a list. It should then output a JSON file with this structure: {\"pages\": {\"name-of-file.html\": [\"url\"], {\"name-of-file-2.html\": [\"url1\", \"url2\"], ... - as you can see, some files may have more than one URL in their commit history. The script should be called gather_links.py and it should save a JSON file called gathered_links.json</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I really didn't think very hard about this first prompt - it was more of a stream of consciousness that I typed into the bot as I thought about the initial problem.</p>\n<p>I inspected the initial result and spotted some problems:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It looks like it just got the start of the URLs, it should be getting the whole URLs which might be to different websites - so just get anything that starts https:// and ends with whitespace or the end of the commit message</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then I changed my mind - I wanted those full commit messages too:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Update the script - I want to capture the full commit messages AND the URLs - the new format should be {\"pages\": {\"aria-live-regions.html\": {\"commits\": [{\"hash\": hash, \"message\": message, \"date\": iso formatted date], \"urls\": [list of URLs like before]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Providing examples like this is a great shortcut to getting exactly what you want.</p>\n<p>Note that at no point have I looked at the code it's written in <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/87e2577983f11fc9c7bf7b7a268cf2404a21e1c5/gather_links.py\">gather_links.py</a>! This is pure vibe-coding: I'm looking at what it's doing, but I've left the implementation details entirely up to the LLM.</p>\n<p>The JSON looked good to me, so I said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is working great. Write me a new script called build_colophon.py which looks through that gathered JSON file and builds and saves an HTML page. The page should be mobile friendly and should list every page - with a link to that page - and for each one display the commit messages neatly (convert newlines to br and linkify URLs but no other formatting) - plus the commit message dates and links to the commits themselves which are in <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools\">https://github.com/simonw/tools</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Claude knows how GitHub URLs works, so telling it to link to the commits and providing the repo name was enough for it guess <code>https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/fd9daf885c924ba277806b3440457d52b0ad90a8</code> for those commit URLs.</p>\n<p>I tend to find Claude has good default taste when it comes to web page design - I said \"the page should be mobile friendly\" and left it at that.</p>\n<p>Claude churned away and built me a page that wasn't right, so I said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it's not working right. ocr.html had a bunch of commits but in colophon.html there is only one link and heading for the first commit and the rest are shown within that same block - there should be separate HTML chunks with links and formatted dates for each of the other commits. Also the neatly formatted date should include the HH:MM as well as the date</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It fixed the bug all on its own, leaving just two changes I decided to make:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it's almost perfect, but each page should have the commits displayed in the opposite order - oldest first</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One last change - the pages are currently listed alphabetically, lets instead list them with the most recently modified at the top</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that was the entire project! Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/1e04f12a1cacea8856946162457d0d77e60ee549/build_colophon.py\">build_colophon.py</a>, and the page it generated came out <a href=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/colophon.html\">looking pretty good</a>:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Tools Colophon.

I wanted a custom GitHub Pages build process.</p>\n<p>I started a brand new Claude Code session (clearing the slate) to see if that was something Claude could figure out too:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This repo is deployed using GitHub Pages. I want to modify the build slightly - before deploying to GitHub Pages it should run python gather_links.py which will generate a file called gathered_links.json - then it should run python build_colophon.py which will use that file to create colophon.html - I want both gathered_links.json and colophon.html to be published to GitHub pages but I do not want them checked into the repo itself</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unlike the first time, this time I watched what it was doing very closely - I don't know how to customize GitHub Pages builds in this way and I wanted to both learn how to do it and stay cautious that it might hallucinate details and fail at the task.</p>\n<p>It told me it wanted to create this file and asked for my permission:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-yaml\"><pre><span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Deploy to GitHub Pages</span>\n\n<span class=\"pl-ent\">on</span>:\n  <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> Run on push to main branch</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">push</span>:\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">branches</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">[ main ]</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> Allow manual trigger</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">workflow_dispatch</span>:\n\n<span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN</span>\n<span class=\"pl-ent\">permissions</span>:\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">contents</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">read</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">pages</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">write</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">id-token</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">write</span>\n\n<span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> Allow only one concurrent deployment</span>\n<span class=\"pl-ent\">concurrency</span>:\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">group</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">pages</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">cancel-in-progress</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">true</span>\n\n<span class=\"pl-ent\">jobs</span>:\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">build</span>:\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">runs-on</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">ubuntu-latest</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">steps</span>:\n      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Checkout</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">uses</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">actions/checkout@v4</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">with</span>:\n          <span class=\"pl-ent\">fetch-depth</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">0</span>  <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> Need full history for git log in gather_links.py</span>\n\n      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Setup Python</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">uses</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">actions/setup-python@v5</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">with</span>:\n          <span class=\"pl-ent\">python-version</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>3.12<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\n\n      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Install dependencies</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">run</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">|</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          python -m pip install --upgrade pip</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\"></span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\"></span>      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Generate links and build colophon</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">run</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">|</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          python gather_links.py</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          python build_colophon.py</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\"></span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\"></span>      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Setup Pages</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">uses</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">actions/configure-pages@v4</span>\n\n      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Build with Jekyll</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">uses</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1</span>\n\n      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Upload artifact</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">uses</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3</span>\n\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">deploy</span>:\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">environment</span>:\n      <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">github-pages</span>\n      <span class=\"pl-ent\">url</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">runs-on</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">ubuntu-latest</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">needs</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">build</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">steps</span>:\n      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Deploy to GitHub Pages</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">id</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">deployment</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">uses</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">actions/deploy-pages@v4</span></pre></div>\n<p>I guess that's right? I appreciated that comment about \"Need full history for git log in gather_links.py\" - that's something I could easily have missed.</p>\n<p>Then it said it wanted to add those files to <code>.gitignore</code> - sounds like a good idea.</p>\n<p>It spat out this summary of its actions so far:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've created a GitHub Actions workflow for GitHub Pages that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Creates a .github/workflows/pages.yml file that:\n<ul>\n<li>Runs on pushes to main branch</li>\n<li>Checkouts the full git history (needed for gather_links.py)</li>\n<li>Sets up Python 3.12</li>\n<li>Runs both scripts in sequence to generate the files</li>\n<li>Builds and deploys to GitHub Pages</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Created .gitignore file to prevent the generated files from being committed</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now when you push to main, GitHub Actions will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run the gather_links.py script to create gathered_links.json</li>\n<li>Run build_colophon.py to create colophon.html</li>\n<li>Deploy both files (and all other files) to GitHub Pages</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I checked to see how much it had cost:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; /cost \n  \u23bf  Total cost: $0.1788\n     Total duration (API): 44.6s\n     Total duration (wall): 10m 18.6s\n</code></pre>\n<p>So 17 cents and 45 seconds using the Claude API. (I got distracted, hence the 10m of total time.) Here's the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/a560b07eef577e6183021d1ccaae7e07\">full transcript</a>.</p>\n<p>The code didn't look like it would irreversibly break anything, so I pushed it to GitHub to see what would happen.</p>\n<p>... and it worked! My new <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon\">colophon page</a> was live.</p>\n<p>There's a catch. I watched the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools/actions\">GitHub Actions</a> interface while it was running and something didn't look right:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"GitHub Actions interface showing three completed actions. Test for Custom pages workflow for colophon,2 Deploy for that same name and another one called pages-build-deployment.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/github-actions-colophon.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I was expecting that \"Test\" job, but why were there two separate deploys?</p>\n<p>I had a hunch that the previous, default Jekyll deploy was still running, while the new deploy ran at the same time - and it was pure luck of the timing that the new script finished later and over-wrote the result of the original.</p>\n<p>It was time to ditch the LLMs and read some documentation!</p>\n<p>I found this page on <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages\">Using custom workflows with GitHub Pages</a> but it didn't tell me what I needed to know.</p>\n<p>On another hunch I checked the GitHub Pages settings interface for my repo and found this option:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"GitHub Pages UI - shows your site is live at tools.simonwillison.net, deployed 7 minutes ago. - then under Buyld and deployment a source menu shows options for GitHub Actions or for Deploy from a branch (selected)\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/github-pages-settings.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>My repo was set to \"Deploy from a branch\", so I switched that over to \"GitHub Actions\".</p>\n<p>I manually updated my <code>README.md</code> to add a link to the new Colophon page in <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/4ee15aaad8e9a412505210a30f485528cb3c0390\">this commit</a>, which triggered another build.</p>\n<p>This time only two jobs ran, and the end result was the correctly deployed site:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Only two in-progress workflows now, one is the Test one and the other is the Deploy to GitHub Pages one.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/github-actions-colophon-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>(I later spotted another bug - some of the links inadvertently included <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags in their <code>href=</code>, which I <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/87e2577983f11fc9c7bf7b7a268cf2404a21e1c5\">fixed</a> with another <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/d5ccbca1b530868980609222790a97cb\">11 cent Claude Code session</a>.)</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: I improved the colophon further by <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/13/tools-colophon/\">adding AI-generated descriptions of the tools</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"be-ready-for-the-human-to-take-over\">Be ready for the human to take over</h4>\n<p>I got lucky with this example because it helped illustrate my final point: expect to need to take over.</p>\n<p>LLMs are no replacement for human intuition and experience. I've spent enough time with GitHub Actions that I know what kind of things to look for, and in this case it was faster for me to step in and finish the project rather than keep on trying to get there with prompts.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-biggest-advantage-is-speed-of-development\">The biggest advantage is speed of development</h4>\n<p>My new <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon\">colophon page</a> took me just under half an hour from conception to finished, deployed feature.</p>\n<p>I'm certain it would have taken me significantly longer without LLM assistance - to the point that I probably wouldn't have bothered to build it at all.</p>\n<p><em>This</em> is why I care so much about the productivity boost I get from LLMs so much: it's not about getting work done faster, it's about being able to ship projects that I wouldn't have been able to justify spending time on at all.</p>\n<p>I wrote about this in March 2023: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/27/ai-enhanced-development/\">AI-enhanced development makes me more ambitious with my projects</a>. Two years later that effect shows no sign of wearing off.</p>\n<p>It's also a great way to accelerate learning new things - today that was how to customize my GitHub Pages builds using Actions, which is something I'll certainly use again in the future.</p>\n<p>The fact that LLMs let me execute my ideas faster means I can implement more of them, which means I can learn even more.</p>\n<h4 id=\"llms-amplify-existing-expertise\">LLMs amplify existing expertise</h4>\n<p>Could anyone else have done this project in the same way? Probably not! My prompting here leaned on 25+ years of professional coding experience, including my previous explorations of GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages, GitHub itself and the LLM tools I put into play.</p>\n<p>I also <em>knew</em> that this was going to work. I've spent enough time working with these tools that I was confident that assembling a new HTML page with information pulled from my Git history was entirely within the capabilities of a good LLM.</p>\n<p>My prompts reflected that - there was nothing particularly novel here, so I dictated the design, tested the results as it was working and occasionally nudged it to fix a bug.</p>\n<p>If I was trying to build a Linux kernel driver - a field I know virtually nothing about - my process would be entirely different.</p>\n<h4 id=\"bonus-answering-questions-about-codebases\">Bonus: answering questions about codebases</h4>\n<p>If the idea of using LLMs to write code for you still feels deeply unappealing, there's another use-case for them which you may find more compelling.</p>\n<p>Good LLMs are <em>great</em> at answering questions about code.</p>\n<p>This is also very low stakes: the worst that can happen is they might get something wrong, which may take you a tiny bit longer to figure out. It's still likely to save you time compared to digging through thousands of lines of code entirely by yourself.</p>\n<p>The trick here is to dump the code into a long context model and start asking questions. My current favorite for this is the catchily titled <code>gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05</code>, a preview of Google's Gemini 2.0 Pro which is currently free to use via their API.</p>\n<p>I used this trick just <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/6/monolith/\">the other day</a>. I was trying out a new-to-me tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/Y2Z/monolith\">monolith</a>, a CLI tool written in Rust which downloads a web page and all of its dependent assets (CSS, images etc) and bundles them together into a single archived file.</p>\n<p>I was curious as to how it worked, so I cloned it into my temporary directory and ran these commands:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c1\">cd</span> /tmp\ngit clone https://github.com/Y2Z/monolith\n<span class=\"pl-c1\">cd</span> monolith\n\nfiles-to-prompt <span class=\"pl-c1\">.</span> -c <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> llm -m gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05 \\\n  -s <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>architectural overview as markdown<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>I'm using my own <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt\">files-to-prompt</a> tool (built for me by Claude 3 Opus <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/8/files-to-prompt/\">last year</a>) here to gather the contents of all of the files in the repo into a single stream. Then I pipe that into my <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/\">LLM</a> tool and tell it (via the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini\">llm-gemini</a> plugin) to prompt Gemini 2.0 Pro with a system prompt of \"architectural overview as markdown\".</p>\n<p>This gave me back a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/2c80749935ae3339d6f7175dc7cf325b\">detailed document</a> describing how the tool works - which source files do what and, crucially, which Rust crates it was using. I learned that it used <code>reqwest</code>, <code>html5ever</code>, <code>markup5ever_rcdom</code> and <code>cssparser</code> and that it doesn't evaluate JavaScript at all, an important limitation.</p>\n<p>I use this trick several times a week. It's a great way to start diving into a new codebase - and often the alternative isn't spending more time on this, it's failing to satisfy my curiosity at all.</p>\n<p>I included three more examples in <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/14/files-to-prompt/\">this recent post</a>.</p>",

All they do is predict a sequence of tokens - but it turns out writing code is mostly about stringing tokens together in the right order, so they can be <em>extremely</em> useful for this provided you point them in the right direction.</p>\n<p>If you assume that this technology will implement your project perfectly without you needing to exercise any of your own skill you'll quickly be disappointed.</p>\n<p>Instead, use them to <em>augment</em> your abilities. My current favorite mental model is to think of them as an over-confident pair programming assistant who's lightning fast at looking things up, can churn out relevant examples at a moment's notice and can execute on tedious tasks without complaint.</p>\n<p><strong>Over-confident</strong> is important. They'll absolutely make mistakes - sometimes subtle, sometimes huge. These mistakes can be <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/kellan-elliott-mccrea/\">deeply inhuman</a> - if a human collaborator hallucinated a non-existent library or method you would instantly lose trust in them. Don't fall into the trap of anthropomorphizing LLMs and assuming that failures which would discredit a human should discredit the machine in the same way.</p>\n<p>When working with LLMs you'll often find things that they just cannot do. Make a note of these - they are useful lessons! They're also valuable examples to stash away for the future - a sign of a strong new model is when it produces usable results for a task that previous models had been unable to handle.</p>\n<h4 id=\"account-for-training-cut-off-dates\">Account for training cut-off dates</h4>\n<p>A crucial characteristic of any model is its <strong>training cut-off date</strong>. This is the date at which the data they were trained on stopped being collected. For OpenAI's models this is usually October of 2023. Anthropic and Gemini and other providers may have more recent dates.</p>\n<p>This is <em>extremely</em> important for code, because it influences what libraries they will be familiar with. If the library you are using had a major breaking change since October 2023, OpenAI models won't know about it!</p>\n<p>I gain enough value from LLMs that I now deliberately consider this when picking a library - I try to stick with libraries with good stability and that are popular enough that many examples of them will have made it into the training data. I like applying the principles of <a href=\"https://boringtechnology.club/\">boring technology</a> - innovate on your project's unique selling points, stick with tried and tested solutions for everything else.</p>\n<p>LLMs can still help you work with libraries that exist outside their training data, but you need to put in more work - you'll need to feed them recent examples of how those libraries should be used as part of your prompt.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the most important thing to understand when working with LLMs:</p>\n<h4 id=\"context-is-king\">Context is king</h4>\n<p>Most of the craft of getting good results out of an LLM comes down to managing its context - the text that is part of your current conversation.</p>\n<p>This context isn't just the prompt that you have fed it: successful LLM interactions usually take the form of conversations, and the context consists of every message from you <em>and</em> every reply from the LLM that exist in the current conversation thread.</p>\n<p>When you start a new conversation you reset that context back to zero. This is important to know, as often the fix for a conversation that has stopped being useful is to wipe the slate clean and start again.</p>\n<p>Some LLM coding tools go beyond just the conversation. Claude Projects for example allow you to pre-populate the context with quite a large amount of text - including a recent ability to <a href=\"https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10167454-using-the-github-integration\">import code directly from a GitHub</a> repository which I'm using a <em>lot</em>.</p>\n<p>Tools like Cursor and VS Code Copilot include context from your current editor session and file layout automatically, and you can sometimes use mechanisms like <a href=\"https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/overview\">Cursor's @commands</a> to pull in additional files or documentation.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons I mostly work directly with the <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\">ChatGPT</a> and <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\">Claude</a> web or app interfaces is that it makes it easier for me to understand exactly what is going into the context. LLM tools that obscure that context from me are <em>less</em> effective.</p>\n<p>You can use the fact that previous replies are also part of the context to your advantage. For complex coding tasks try getting the LLM to write a simpler version first, check that it works and then iterate on building to the more sophisticated implementation.</p>\n<p>I often start a new chat by dumping in existing code to seed that context, then work with the LLM to modify it in some way.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite code prompting techniques is to drop in several full examples relating to something I want to build, then prompt the LLM to use them as inspiration for a new project. I wrote about that in detail when I <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/30/ocr-pdfs-images/\">described my JavaScript OCR application</a> that combines Tesseract.js and PDF.js - two libraries I had used in the past and for which I could provide working examples in the prompt.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ask-them-for-options\">Ask them for options</h4>\n<p>Most of my projects start with some open questions: is the thing I'm trying to do possible? What are the potential ways I could implement it? Which of those options are the <em>best</em>?</p>\n<p>I use LLMs as part of this initial research phase.</p>\n<p>I'll use prompts like \"what are options for HTTP libraries in Rust? Include usage examples\" - or \"what are some useful drag-and-drop libraries in JavaScript? Build me an artifact demonstrating each one\" (to Claude).</p>\n<p>The training cut-off is relevant here, since it means newer libraries won't be suggested. Usually that's OK - I don't want the latest, I want the most stable and the one that has been around for long enough for the bugs to be ironed out.</p>\n<p>If I'm going to use something more recent I'll do that research myself, outside of LLM world.</p>\n<p>The best way to start any project is with a prototype that proves that the key requirements of that project can be met. I often find that an LLM can get me to that working prototype within a few minutes of me sitting down with my laptop - or sometimes even while working on my phone.</p>\n<h4 id=\"tell-them-exactly-what-to-do\">Tell them exactly what to do</h4>\n<p>Once I've completed the initial research I change modes dramatically. For production code my LLM usage is much more authoritarian: I treat it like a digital intern, hired to type code for me based on my detailed instructions.</p>\n<p>Here's a recent example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Write a Python function that uses asyncio httpx with this signature:</p>\n<pre><code>async def download_db(url, max_size_bytes=5 * 1025 * 1025): -&gt; pathlib.Path\n</code></pre>\n<p>Given a URL, this downloads the database to a temp directory and returns a path to it. BUT it checks the content length header at the start of streaming back that data and, if it's more than the limit, raises an error. When the download finishes it uses <code>sqlite3.connect(...)</code> and then runs a <code>PRAGMA quick_check</code> to confirm the SQLite data is valid - raising an error if not. Finally, if the content length header lies to us -  if it says 2MB but we download 3MB - we get an error raised as soon as we notice that problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I could write this function myself, but it would take me the better part of fifteen minutes to look up all of the details and get the code working right. Claude knocked it out <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/5aed8bd87016c77465c23e0dc4563ec9\">in 15 seconds</a>.</p>\n<p>I find LLMs respond extremely well to function signatures like the one I use here. I get to act as the function designer, the LLM does the work of building the body to my specification.</p>\n<p>I'll often follow-up with \"Now write me the tests using pytest\". Again, I dictate my technology of choice - I want the LLM to save me the time of having to type out the code that's sitting in my head already.</p>\n<p>If your reaction to this is \"surely typing out the code is faster than typing out an English instruction of it\", all I can tell you is that it really isn't for me any more. Code needs to be correct. English has enormous room for shortcuts, and vagaries, and typos, and saying things like \"use that popular HTTP library\" if you can't remember the name off the top of your head.</p>\n<p>The good coding LLMs are excellent at filling in the gaps. They're also much less lazy than me - they'll remember to catch likely exceptions, add accurate docstrings, and annotate code with the relevant types.</p>\n<h4 id=\"you-have-to-test-what-it-writes-\">You have to test what it writes!</h4>\n<p>I wrote about this <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/hallucinations-in-code/#qa\">at length last week</a>: the one thing you absolutely cannot outsource to the machine is testing that the code actually works.</p>\n<p>Your responsibility as a software developer is to deliver working systems. If you haven't seen it run, it's not a working system. You need to invest in strengthening those manual QA habits.</p>\n<p>This may not be glamorous but it's always been a critical part of shipping good code, with or without the involvement of LLMs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"remember-it-s-a-conversation\">Remember it's a conversation</h4>\n<p>If I don't like what an LLM has written, they'll <em>never</em> complain at being told to refactor it! \"Break that repetitive code out into a function\", \"use string manipulation methods rather than a regular expression\", or even \"write that better!\" - the code an LLM produces first time is rarely the final implementation, but they can re-type it dozens of times for you without ever getting frustrated or bored.</p>\n<p>Occasionally I'll get a great result from my first prompt - more frequently the more I practice - but I expect to need at least a few follow-ups.</p>\n<p>I often wonder if this is one of the key tricks that people are missing - a bad initial result isn't a failure, it's a starting point for pushing the model in the direction of the thing you actually want.</p>\n<h4 id=\"use-tools-that-can-run-the-code-for-you\">Use tools that can run the code for you</h4>\n<p>An increasing number of LLM coding tools now have the ability to <em>run that code</em> for you. I'm slightly cautious about some of these since there's a possibility of the wrong command causing real damage, so I tend to stick to the ones that run code in a safe sandbox. My favorites right now are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>ChatGPT Code Interpreter</strong>, where ChatGPT can write and then execute Python code directly in a Kubernetes sandbox VM managed by OpenAI. This is completely safe - it can't even make outbound network connections so really all that can happen is the temporary filesystem gets mangled and then reset.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Claude Artifacts</strong>, where Claude can build you a full HTML+JavaScript+CSS web application that is displayed within the Claude interface. This web app is displayed in a <em>very</em> locked down iframe sandbox, greatly restricting what it can do but preventing problems like accidental exfiltration of your private Claude data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>ChatGPT Canvas</strong> is a newer ChatGPT feature with similar capabilites to Claude Artifacts. I have not explored this enough myself yet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And if you're willing to live a little more dangerously:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.cursor.com/\">Cursor</a></strong> has an \"Agent\" feature that can do this, as does <strong><a href=\"https://codeium.com/windsurf\">Windsurf</a></strong> and a growing number of other editors. I haven't spent enough time with these to make recommendations yet.</li>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://aider.chat/\">Aider</a></strong> is the leading open source implementation of these kinds of patterns, and is a great example of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food\">dogfooding</a> - recent releases of Aider have been <a href=\"https://aider.chat/HISTORY.html\">80%+ written</a> by Aider itself.</li>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview\">Claude Code</a></strong> is Anthropic's new entrant into this space. I'll provide a detailed description of using that tool shortly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This run-the-code-in-a-loop pattern is so powerful that I chose my core LLM tools for coding based primarily on whether they can safely run and iterate on my code.</p>\n<h4 id=\"vibe-coding-is-a-great-way-to-learn\">Vibe-coding is a great way to learn</h4>\n<p>Andrej Karpathy <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/6/andrej-karpathy/\">coined the term</a> vibe-coding just over a month ago, and it has stuck:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There's a new kind of coding I call \"vibe coding\", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. [...] I ask for the dumbest things like \"decrease the padding on the sidebar by half\" because I'm too lazy to find it. I \"Accept All\" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Andrej suggests this is \"not too bad for throwaway weekend projects\". It's also a <em>fantastic</em> way to explore the capabilities of these models - and really fun.</p>\n<p>The best way to learn LLMs is to play with them. Throwing absurd ideas at them and vibe-coding until they almost sort-of work is a genuinely useful way to accelerate the rate at which you build intuition for what works and what doesn't.</p>\n<p>I've been vibe-coding since before Andrej gave it a name! My <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools\">simonw/tools</a> GitHub repository has 77 HTML+JavaScript apps and 6 Python apps, and every single one of them was built by prompting LLMs. I have learned <em>so much</em> from building this collection, and I add to it at a rate of several new prototypes per week.</p>\n<p>You can try most of mine out directly on <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/\">tools.simonwillison.net</a> - a GitHub Pages published version of the repo. I wrote more detailed notes on some of these back in October in <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/\">Everything I built with Claude Artifacts this week</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to see the transcript of the chat used for each one it's almost always linked to in the commit history for that page - or visit the new <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon\">colophon page</a> for an index that includes all of those links.</p>\n<h4 id=\"a-detailed-example\">A detailed example using Claude Code</h4>\n<p>While I was writing this article I had the idea for that <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon\">tools.simonwillison.net/colophon</a> page - I wanted something I could link to that showed the commit history of each of my tools in a more obvious way than GitHub.</p>\n<p>I decided to use that as an opportunity to demonstrate my AI-assisted coding process.</p>\n<p>For this one I used <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview\">Claude Code</a>, because I wanted it to be able to run Python code directly against my existing tools repository on my laptop.</p>\n<p>Running the <code>/cost</code> command at the end of my session showed me this:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; /cost \n  \u23bf  Total cost: $0.61\n     Total duration (API): 5m 31.2s\n     Total duration (wall): 17m 18.7s\n</code></pre>\n<p>The initial project took me just over 17 minutes from start to finish, and cost me 61 cents in API calls to Anthropic.</p>\n<p>I used the authoritarian process where I told the model exactly what I wanted to build. Here's my sequence of prompts (<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/323e1b00ee4f8453c7834a7560eeafc1\">full transcript here</a>).</p>\n<p>I started by asking for an initial script to gather the data needed for the new page:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Almost all of the HTML files in this directory were created using Claude prompts, and the details of those prompts are linked in the commit messages. Build a Python script that checks the commit history for each HTML file in turn and extracts any URLs from those commit messages into a list. It should then output a JSON file with this structure: {\"pages\": {\"name-of-file.html\": [\"url\"], {\"name-of-file-2.html\": [\"url1\", \"url2\"], ... - as you can see, some files may have more than one URL in their commit history. The script should be called gather_links.py and it should save a JSON file called gathered_links.json</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I really didn't think very hard about this first prompt - it was more of a stream of consciousness that I typed into the bot as I thought about the initial problem.</p>\n<p>I inspected the initial result and spotted some problems:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It looks like it just got the start of the URLs, it should be getting the whole URLs which might be to different websites - so just get anything that starts https:// and ends with whitespace or the end of the commit message</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then I changed my mind - I wanted those full commit messages too:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Update the script - I want to capture the full commit messages AND the URLs - the new format should be {\"pages\": {\"aria-live-regions.html\": {\"commits\": [{\"hash\": hash, \"message\": message, \"date\": iso formatted date], \"urls\": [list of URLs like before]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Providing examples like this is a great shortcut to getting exactly what you want.</p>\n<p>Note that at no point have I looked at the code it's written in <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/87e2577983f11fc9c7bf7b7a268cf2404a21e1c5/gather_links.py\">gather_links.py</a>! This is pure vibe-coding: I'm looking at what it's doing, but I've left the implementation details entirely up to the LLM.</p>\n<p>The JSON looked good to me, so I said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is working great. Write me a new script called build_colophon.py which looks through that gathered JSON file and builds and saves an HTML page. The page should be mobile friendly and should list every page - with a link to that page - and for each one display the commit messages neatly (convert newlines to br and linkify URLs but no other formatting) - plus the commit message dates and links to the commits themselves which are in <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools\">https://github.com/simonw/tools</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Claude knows how GitHub URLs works, so telling it to link to the commits and providing the repo name was enough for it guess <code>https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/fd9daf885c924ba277806b3440457d52b0ad90a8</code> for those commit URLs.</p>\n<p>I tend to find Claude has good default taste when it comes to web page design - I said \"the page should be mobile friendly\" and left it at that.</p>\n<p>Claude churned away and built me a page that wasn't right, so I said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it's not working right. ocr.html had a bunch of commits but in colophon.html there is only one link and heading for the first commit and the rest are shown within that same block - there should be separate HTML chunks with links and formatted dates for each of the other commits. Also the neatly formatted date should include the HH:MM as well as the date</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It fixed the bug all on its own, leaving just two changes I decided to make:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it's almost perfect, but each page should have the commits displayed in the opposite order - oldest first</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One last change - the pages are currently listed alphabetically, lets instead list them with the most recently modified at the top</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that was the entire project! Here's <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/1e04f12a1cacea8856946162457d0d77e60ee549/build_colophon.py\">build_colophon.py</a>, and the page it generated came out <a href=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/colophon.html\">looking pretty good</a>:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Tools Colophon.

I want to modify the build slightly - before deploying to GitHub Pages it should run python gather_links.py which will generate a file called gathered_links.json - then it should run python build_colophon.py which will use that file to create colophon.html - I want both gathered_links.json and colophon.html to be published to GitHub pages but I do not want them checked into the repo itself</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unlike the first time, this time I watched what it was doing very closely - I don't know how to customize GitHub Pages builds in this way and I wanted to both learn how to do it and stay cautious that it might hallucinate details and fail at the task.</p>\n<p>It told me it wanted to create this file and asked for my permission:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-yaml\"><pre><span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Deploy to GitHub Pages</span>\n\n<span class=\"pl-ent\">on</span>:\n  <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> Run on push to main branch</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">push</span>:\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">branches</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">[ main ]</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> Allow manual trigger</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">workflow_dispatch</span>:\n\n<span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN</span>\n<span class=\"pl-ent\">permissions</span>:\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">contents</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">read</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">pages</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">write</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">id-token</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">write</span>\n\n<span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> Allow only one concurrent deployment</span>\n<span class=\"pl-ent\">concurrency</span>:\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">group</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">pages</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">cancel-in-progress</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">true</span>\n\n<span class=\"pl-ent\">jobs</span>:\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">build</span>:\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">runs-on</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">ubuntu-latest</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">steps</span>:\n      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Checkout</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">uses</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">actions/checkout@v4</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">with</span>:\n          <span class=\"pl-ent\">fetch-depth</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">0</span>  <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">#</span> Need full history for git log in gather_links.py</span>\n\n      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Setup Python</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">uses</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">actions/setup-python@v5</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">with</span>:\n          <span class=\"pl-ent\">python-version</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>3.12<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\n\n      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Install dependencies</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">run</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">|</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          python -m pip install --upgrade pip</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\"></span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\"></span>      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Generate links and build colophon</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">run</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">|</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          python gather_links.py</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          python build_colophon.py</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\"></span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\"></span>      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Setup Pages</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">uses</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">actions/configure-pages@v4</span>\n\n      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Build with Jekyll</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">uses</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1</span>\n\n      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Upload artifact</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">uses</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3</span>\n\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">deploy</span>:\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">environment</span>:\n      <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">github-pages</span>\n      <span class=\"pl-ent\">url</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">runs-on</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">ubuntu-latest</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">needs</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">build</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">steps</span>:\n      - <span class=\"pl-ent\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Deploy to GitHub Pages</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">id</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">deployment</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">uses</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">actions/deploy-pages@v4</span></pre></div>\n<p>I guess that's right? I appreciated that comment about \"Need full history for git log in gather_links.py\" - that's something I could easily have missed.</p>\n<p>Then it said it wanted to add those files to <code>.gitignore</code> - sounds like a good idea.</p>\n<p>It spat out this summary of its actions so far:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've created a GitHub Actions workflow for GitHub Pages that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Creates a .github/workflows/pages.yml file that:\n<ul>\n<li>Runs on pushes to main branch</li>\n<li>Checkouts the full git history (needed for gather_links.py)</li>\n<li>Sets up Python 3.12</li>\n<li>Runs both scripts in sequence to generate the files</li>\n<li>Builds and deploys to GitHub Pages</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Created .gitignore file to prevent the generated files from being committed</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now when you push to main, GitHub Actions will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run the gather_links.py script to create gathered_links.json</li>\n<li>Run build_colophon.py to create colophon.html</li>\n<li>Deploy both files (and all other files) to GitHub Pages</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I checked to see how much it had cost:</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; /cost \n  \u23bf  Total cost: $0.1788\n     Total duration (API): 44.6s\n     Total duration (wall): 10m 18.6s\n</code></pre>\n<p>So 17 cents and 45 seconds using the Claude API. (I got distracted, hence the 10m of total time.) Here's the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/a560b07eef577e6183021d1ccaae7e07\">full transcript</a>.</p>\n<p>The code didn't look like it would irreversibly break anything, so I pushed it to GitHub to see what would happen.</p>\n<p>... and it worked! My new <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon\">colophon page</a> was live.</p>\n<p>There's a catch. I watched the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools/actions\">GitHub Actions</a> interface while it was running and something didn't look right:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"GitHub Actions interface showing three completed actions. Test for Custom pages workflow for colophon,2 Deploy for that same name and another one called pages-build-deployment.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/github-actions-colophon.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I was expecting that \"Test\" job, but why were there two separate deploys?</p>\n<p>I had a hunch that the previous, default Jekyll deploy was still running, while the new deploy ran at the same time - and it was pure luck of the timing that the new script finished later and over-wrote the result of the original.</p>\n<p>It was time to ditch the LLMs and read some documentation!</p>\n<p>I found this page on <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages\">Using custom workflows with GitHub Pages</a> but it didn't tell me what I needed to know.</p>\n<p>On another hunch I checked the GitHub Pages settings interface for my repo and found this option:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"GitHub Pages UI - shows your site is live at tools.simonwillison.net, deployed 7 minutes ago. - then under Buyld and deployment a source menu shows options for GitHub Actions or for Deploy from a branch (selected)\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/github-pages-settings.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>My repo was set to \"Deploy from a branch\", so I switched that over to \"GitHub Actions\".</p>\n<p>I manually updated my <code>README.md</code> to add a link to the new Colophon page in <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/4ee15aaad8e9a412505210a30f485528cb3c0390\">this commit</a>, which triggered another build.</p>\n<p>This time only two jobs ran, and the end result was the correctly deployed site:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Only two in-progress workflows now, one is the Test one and the other is the Deploy to GitHub Pages one.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/github-actions-colophon-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>(I later spotted another bug - some of the links inadvertently included <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags in their <code>href=</code>, which I <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/87e2577983f11fc9c7bf7b7a268cf2404a21e1c5\">fixed</a> with another <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/d5ccbca1b530868980609222790a97cb\">11 cent Claude Code session</a>.)</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: I improved the colophon further by <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/13/tools-colophon/\">adding AI-generated descriptions of the tools</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"be-ready-for-the-human-to-take-over\">Be ready for the human to take over</h4>\n<p>I got lucky with this example because it helped illustrate my final point: expect to need to take over.</p>\n<p>LLMs are no replacement for human intuition and experience. I've spent enough time with GitHub Actions that I know what kind of things to look for, and in this case it was faster for me to step in and finish the project rather than keep on trying to get there with prompts.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-biggest-advantage-is-speed-of-development\">The biggest advantage is speed of development</h4>\n<p>My new <a href=\"https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon\">colophon page</a> took me just under half an hour from conception to finished, deployed feature.</p>\n<p>I'm certain it would have taken me significantly longer without LLM assistance - to the point that I probably wouldn't have bothered to build it at all.</p>\n<p><em>This</em> is why I care so much about the productivity boost I get from LLMs so much: it's not about getting work done faster, it's about being able to ship projects that I wouldn't have been able to justify spending time on at all.</p>\n<p>I wrote about this in March 2023: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/27/ai-enhanced-development/\">AI-enhanced development makes me more ambitious with my projects</a>. Two years later that effect shows no sign of wearing off.</p>\n<p>It's also a great way to accelerate learning new things - today that was how to customize my GitHub Pages builds using Actions, which is something I'll certainly use again in the future.</p>\n<p>The fact that LLMs let me execute my ideas faster means I can implement more of them, which means I can learn even more.</p>\n<h4 id=\"llms-amplify-existing-expertise\">LLMs amplify existing expertise</h4>\n<p>Could anyone else have done this project in the same way? Probably not! My prompting here leaned on 25+ years of professional coding experience, including my previous explorations of GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages, GitHub itself and the LLM tools I put into play.</p>\n<p>I also <em>knew</em> that this was going to work. I've spent enough time working with these tools that I was confident that assembling a new HTML page with information pulled from my Git history was entirely within the capabilities of a good LLM.</p>\n<p>My prompts reflected that - there was nothing particularly novel here, so I dictated the design, tested the results as it was working and occasionally nudged it to fix a bug.</p>\n<p>If I was trying to build a Linux kernel driver - a field I know virtually nothing about - my process would be entirely different.</p>\n<h4 id=\"bonus-answering-questions-about-codebases\">Bonus: answering questions about codebases</h4>\n<p>If the idea of using LLMs to write code for you still feels deeply unappealing, there's another use-case for them which you may find more compelling.</p>\n<p>Good LLMs are <em>great</em> at answering questions about code.</p>\n<p>This is also very low stakes: the worst that can happen is they might get something wrong, which may take you a tiny bit longer to figure out. It's still likely to save you time compared to digging through thousands of lines of code entirely by yourself.</p>\n<p>The trick here is to dump the code into a long context model and start asking questions. My current favorite for this is the catchily titled <code>gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05</code>, a preview of Google's Gemini 2.0 Pro which is currently free to use via their API.</p>\n<p>I used this trick just <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/6/monolith/\">the other day</a>. I was trying out a new-to-me tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/Y2Z/monolith\">monolith</a>, a CLI tool written in Rust which downloads a web page and all of its dependent assets (CSS, images etc) and bundles them together into a single archived file.</p>\n<p>I was curious as to how it worked, so I cloned it into my temporary directory and ran these commands:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c1\">cd</span> /tmp\ngit clone https://github.com/Y2Z/monolith\n<span class=\"pl-c1\">cd</span> monolith\n\nfiles-to-prompt <span class=\"pl-c1\">.</span> -c <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> llm -m gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05 \\\n  -s <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>architectural overview as markdown<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>I'm using my own <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt\">files-to-prompt</a> tool (built for me by Claude 3 Opus <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/8/files-to-prompt/\">last year</a>) here to gather the contents of all of the files in the repo into a single stream. Then I pipe that into my <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/\">LLM</a> tool and tell it (via the <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini\">llm-gemini</a> plugin) to prompt Gemini 2.0 Pro with a system prompt of \"architectural overview as markdown\".</p>\n<p>This gave me back a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/2c80749935ae3339d6f7175dc7cf325b\">detailed document</a> describing how the tool works - which source files do what and, crucially, which Rust crates it was using. I learned that it used <code>reqwest</code>, <code>html5ever</code>, <code>markup5ever_rcdom</code> and <code>cssparser</code> and that it doesn't evaluate JavaScript at all, an important limitation.</p>\n<p>I use this trick several times a week. It's a great way to start diving into a new codebase - and often the alternative isn't spending more time on this, it's failing to satisfy my curiosity at all.</p>\n<p>I included three more examples in <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/14/files-to-prompt/\">this recent post</a>.</p>"

If you live in the SF Bay Area and are not yet aware of the Crucible I'm delighted to introduce you - it's a phenomenal non-profit art school with an enormous warehouse that teaches blacksmithing, glass blowing, welding, ceramics, woodwork and dozens of other crafts. Here's <a href=\"https://www.thecrucible.org/course-search/\">their course catalog</a>. Go enrich your soul!</p>\n<p>I took their class in \"Mechanical Sculpture\", which turned out to be <em>exactly</em> a class in how to make automata. I guess the term \"automota\" isn't widely enough known to use in the course description!</p>\n<p>The class was small - two students and one instructor - which meant that we got an extremely personalized experience.</p>\n<h4 id=\"what-i-built\">What I built</h4>\n<p>On day one we worked together on a class project. I suggested a pelican, and we built exactly that - a single glorious pelican that flapped its wings and swooped from side to side.</p>\n<p>Day two was when we got to build our own things. We'd already built a pelican, but I wanted one of my own... so I figured the only thing better than a pelican is a full squadron of them!</p>\n<p>Hence, Squadron. Here's a video of my finished piece in action:</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0.4em;\">\n    <video controls=\"controls\" loop=\"loop\" poster=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/squadron.jpg\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n        <source src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/squadron-demo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n    </video>\n</div>\n\n<p>I think it captures their pelican charisma pretty well!</p>\n<h4 id=\"how-i-built-it\">How I built it</h4>\n<p>I was delighted to learn from the class that the tools needed to build simple automata are actually quite accessible:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A power drill</li>\n<li>A saw - we used a Japanese pull saw</li>\n<li>Wood glue</li>\n<li>Screws</li>\n<li>Wood - we mainly worked with basswood, plus I used some poplar wood for the wings</li>\n<li>Brass wires and rods</li>\n<li>Pliers for working with the wire</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most sophisticated tool we used was a reciprocating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scroll_saw\">scroll saw</a>, for cutting shapes out of the wood. We also had access to a bench sander and a drill press, but those really just sped up processes that can be achieved using sand paper and a regular hand drill.</p>\n<p>I've taken a lot of photos of pelicans over the years. I found this side-on photograph that I liked of two pelicans in flight:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Two glorious pelicans in flight, viewed sideways on\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Then I used the iOS Photos app feature where you can extract an object from a photo as a \"sticker\" and pasted the result into iOS Notes.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of iOS notes - just the first pelican is in the note, with a white background instead of the sky\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/notes-pelican.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I printed the image from there, which gave me a pelican shape on paper. I cut out just the body and used it to trace the shape onto the wood, then ran the wood through the scroll saw. I made three of these, not paying too much attention to accuracy as it's better for them to have slight differences to each other.</p>\n<p>For the wings I started with rectangles of poplar wood, cut using the Japanese saw and attached to the pelican's body using bent brass wire through small drilled holes. I later sketched out a more interesting wing shape on some foam board as a prototype (loosely inspired by photos I had taken), then traced that shape onto the wood and shaped them with the scroll saw and sander.</p>\n<p>Most automata are driven using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_(mechanism)\">cams</a>, and that was the pattern we stuck to in our class as well. Cams are incredibly simple: you have a rotating rod (here driven by a 12V 10RPM motor) and you attach an offset disc to it. That disc can then drive all manner of useful mechanisms.</p>\n<p>For my pelicans the cams lift rods up and down via a \"foot\" that sits on the cam. The feet turned out to be essential - we made one from copper and another from wood. Without feet the mechanism was liable to jam.</p>\n<p>I made both cams by tracing out shapes with a pencil and then cutting the wood with the scroll saw, then using the drill press to add the hole for the rod.</p>\n<p>The front pelican's body sits on a brass rod that lifts up and down, with the wings fixed to wires.</p>\n<p>The back two share a single wooden dowel, sitting on brass wires attached to two small holes drilled into the end.</p>\n<p>To attach the cams to the drive shaft I drilled a small hole through the cam and the brass drive shaft, then hammered in a brass pin to hold the cam in place. Without that there's a risk of the cam slipping around the driving rod rather than rotating firmly in place.</p>\n<p>After adding the pelicans with their fixed wings I ran into a problem: the tension from the wing wiring caused friction between the rod and the base, resulting in the up-and-down motion getting stuck. We were running low on time so our instructor stepped in to help rescue my project with the additional brass tubes shown in the final piece.</p>\n<h4 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h4>\n<p>The main thing I learned from the weekend is that automata building is a much more accessible craft than I had initially expected. The tools and techniques are surprisingly inexpensive, and a weekend (really a single day for my solo project) was enough time to build something that I'm really happy with.</p>\n\n<p>The hardest part turns out to be the fiddling at the very end to get all of the motions just right. I'm still iterating on this now (hence the elastic hair tie and visible pieces of tape) - it's difficult to find the right balance between position, motion and composition. I guess I need to get comfortable with the idea that art is <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/03/01/abandon/\">never finished, merely abandoned</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I've been looking out for a good analog hobby for a while now. Maybe this is the one!</p>",

If you're not familiar with them, they are animated mechanical sculptures. I consider them to be the highest form of art.</p>\n<p>For my birthday this year Natalie signed me up for a two day, 16 hour hour weekend class to make one at <a href=\"https://www.thecrucible.org/\">The Crucible</a> in Oakland. If you live in the SF Bay Area and are not yet aware of the Crucible I'm delighted to introduce you - it's a phenomenal non-profit art school with an enormous warehouse that teaches blacksmithing, glass blowing, welding, ceramics, woodwork and dozens of other crafts. Here's <a href=\"https://www.thecrucible.org/course-search/\">their course catalog</a>. Go enrich your soul!</p>\n<p>I took their class in \"Mechanical Sculpture\", which turned out to be <em>exactly</em> a class in how to make automata. I guess the term \"automota\" isn't widely enough known to use in the course description!</p>\n<p>The class was small - two students and one instructor - which meant that we got an extremely personalized experience.</p>\n<h4 id=\"what-i-built\">What I built</h4>\n<p>On day one we worked together on a class project. I suggested a pelican, and we built exactly that - a single glorious pelican that flapped its wings and swooped from side to side.</p>\n<p>Day two was when we got to build our own things. We'd already built a pelican, but I wanted one of my own... so I figured the only thing better than a pelican is a full squadron of them!</p>\n<p>Hence, Squadron. Here's a video of my finished piece in action:</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 0.4em;\">\n    <video controls=\"controls\" loop=\"loop\" poster=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/squadron.jpg\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto;\">\n        <source src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/squadron-demo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n    </video>\n</div>\n\n<p>I think it captures their pelican charisma pretty well!</p>\n<h4 id=\"how-i-built-it\">How I built it</h4>\n<p>I was delighted to learn from the class that the tools needed to build simple automata are actually quite accessible:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A power drill</li>\n<li>A saw - we used a Japanese pull saw</li>\n<li>Wood glue</li>\n<li>Screws</li>\n<li>Wood - we mainly worked with basswood, plus I used some poplar wood for the wings</li>\n<li>Brass wires and rods</li>\n<li>Pliers for working with the wire</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most sophisticated tool we used was a reciprocating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scroll_saw\">scroll saw</a>, for cutting shapes out of the wood. We also had access to a bench sander and a drill press, but those really just sped up processes that can be achieved using sand paper and a regular hand drill.</p>\n<p>I've taken a lot of photos of pelicans over the years. I found this side-on photograph that I liked of two pelicans in flight:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Two glorious pelicans in flight, viewed sideways on\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Then I used the iOS Photos app feature where you can extract an object from a photo as a \"sticker\" and pasted the result into iOS Notes.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of iOS notes - just the first pelican is in the note, with a white background instead of the sky\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/notes-pelican.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I printed the image from there, which gave me a pelican shape on paper. I cut out just the body and used it to trace the shape onto the wood, then ran the wood through the scroll saw. I made three of these, not paying too much attention to accuracy as it's better for them to have slight differences to each other.</p>\n<p>For the wings I started with rectangles of poplar wood, cut using the Japanese saw and attached to the pelican's body using bent brass wire through small drilled holes. I later sketched out a more interesting wing shape on some foam board as a prototype (loosely inspired by photos I had taken), then traced that shape onto the wood and shaped them with the scroll saw and sander.</p>\n<p>Most automata are driven using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_(mechanism)\">cams</a>, and that was the pattern we stuck to in our class as well. Cams are incredibly simple: you have a rotating rod (here driven by a 12V 10RPM motor) and you attach an offset disc to it. That disc can then drive all manner of useful mechanisms.</p>\n<p>For my pelicans the cams lift rods up and down via a \"foot\" that sits on the cam. The feet turned out to be essential - we made one from copper and another from wood. Without feet the mechanism was liable to jam.</p>\n<p>I made both cams by tracing out shapes with a pencil and then cutting the wood with the scroll saw, then using the drill press to add the hole for the rod.</p>\n<p>The front pelican's body sits on a brass rod that lifts up and down, with the wings fixed to wires.</p>\n<p>The back two share a single wooden dowel, sitting on brass wires attached to two small holes drilled into the end.</p>\n<p>To attach the cams to the drive shaft I drilled a small hole through the cam and the brass drive shaft, then hammered in a brass pin to hold the cam in place. Without that there's a risk of the cam slipping around the driving rod rather than rotating firmly in place.</p>\n<p>After adding the pelicans with their fixed wings I ran into a problem: the tension from the wing wiring caused friction between the rod and the base, resulting in the up-and-down motion getting stuck. We were running low on time so our instructor stepped in to help rescue my project with the additional brass tubes shown in the final piece.</p>\n<h4 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I learned</h4>\n<p>The main thing I learned from the weekend is that automata building is a much more accessible craft than I had initially expected. The tools and techniques are surprisingly inexpensive, and a weekend (really a single day for my solo project) was enough time to build something that I'm really happy with.</p>\n\n<p>The hardest part turns out to be the fiddling at the very end to get all of the motions just right. I'm still iterating on this now (hence the elastic hair tie and visible pieces of tape) - it's difficult to find the right balance between position, motion and composition. I guess I need to get comfortable with the idea that art is <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/03/01/abandon/\">never finished, merely abandoned</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I've been looking out for a good analog hobby for a while now. Maybe this is the one!</p>"

That's the trick where you feed an LLM an article, or a PDF, or a screenshot and use it to turn that into JSON or CSV or some other structured format.</p>\n<p>It's possible to achieve strong results on this with prompting alone: feed data into an LLM, give it an example of the output you would like and let it figure out the details.</p>\n<p>Many of the leading LLM providers now bake this in as a feature. OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and Mistral all offer variants of \"structured output\" as additional options through their API:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OpenAI: <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs\">Structured Outputs</a>\n</li>\n<li>Gemini: <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output?lang=rest\">Generate structured output with the Gemini API</a>\n</li>\n<li>Mistral: <a href=\"https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/structured-output/custom_structured_output/\">Custom Structured Outputs</a>\n</li>\n<li>Anthropic's <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview\">tool use</a> can be used for this, as shown in their <a href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/tool_use/extracting_structured_json.ipynb\">Extracting Structured JSON using Claude and Tool Use</a> cookbook example.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These mechanisms are all very similar: you pass a <a href=\"https://json-schema.org/\">JSON schema</a> to the model defining the shape that you would like, they then use that schema to guide the output of the model.</p>\n<p>How reliable that is can vary! Some providers use tricks along the lines of <a href=\"https://github.com/1rgs/jsonformer\">Jsonformer</a>, compiling the JSON schema into code that interacts with the model's next-token generation at runtime, limiting it to only generate tokens that are valid in the context of the schema.</p>\n<p>Other providers YOLO it - they trust that their model is \"good enough\" that showing it the schema will produce the right results!</p>\n<p>In practice, this means that you need to be aware that sometimes this stuff will go wrong. As with anything LLM, 100% reliability is never guaranteed.</p>\n<p>From my experiments so far, and depending on the model that you chose, these mistakes are rare. If you're using a top tier model it will almost certainly do the right thing.</p>\n<h4 id=\"designing-this-feature-for-llm\">Designing this feature for LLM</h4>\n<p>I've wanted this feature for ages. I see it as an important step on the way to full tool usage, which is something I'm very excited to bring to the CLI tool and Python library.</p>\n<p>LLM is designed as an abstraction layer over different models. This makes building new features <em>much harder</em>, because I need to figure out a common denominator and then build an abstraction that captures as much value as possible while still being general enough to work across multiple models.</p>\n<p>Support for structured output across multiple vendors has matured now to the point that I'm ready to commit to a design.</p>\n<p>My first version of this feature worked exclusively with JSON schemas. An earlier version of the tutorial started with this example:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>curl https://www.nytimes.com/ <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> uvx strip-tags <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> \\\n  llm --schema <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>{</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">  \"type\": \"object\",</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">  \"properties\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">    \"items\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">      \"type\": \"array\",</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">      \"items\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">        \"type\": \"object\",</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">        \"properties\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          \"headline\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">            \"type\": \"string\"</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          },</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          \"short_summary\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">            \"type\": \"string\"</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          },</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          \"key_points\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">            \"type\": \"array\",</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">            \"items\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">              \"type\": \"string\"</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">            }</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          }</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">        },</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">        \"required\": [\"headline\", \"short_summary\", \"key_points\"]</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">      }</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">    }</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">  },</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">  \"required\": [\"items\"]</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">}<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> jq</pre></div>\n<p>Here we're feeding a full JSON schema document to the new <code>llm --schema</code> option, then piping in the homepage of the New York Times (after running it through <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/strip-tags\">strip-tags</a>) and asking for <code>headline</code>, <code>short_summary</code> and <code>key_points</code> for multiple items on the page.</p>\n<p>This example still works with the finished feature - you can see <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/372d11e2729a9745654740ff3f5669ab\">example JSON output here</a> - but constructing those long-form schemas by hand was a big pain.</p>\n<p>So... I invented my own shortcut syntax.</p>\n<p>That earlier example is a simple illustration:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm --schema <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>name,age int,short_bio<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>invent a cool dog<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Here the schema is a comma-separated list of field names, with an optional space-separated type.</p>\n<p>The full concise schema syntax <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/schemas.html#concise-llm-schema-syntax\">is described here</a>. There's a more complex example <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/schemas.html#extracting-people-from-a-news-articles\">in the tutorial</a>, which uses the newline-delimited form to extract information about people who are mentioned in a news article:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>curl <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>https://apnews.com/article/trump-federal-employees-firings-a85d1aaf1088e050d39dcf7e3664bb9f<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> \\\n  uvx strip-tags <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> \\\n  llm --schema-multi <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">name: the person's name</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">organization: who they represent</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">role: their job title or role</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">learned: what we learned about them from this story</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">article_headline: the headline of the story</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">article_date: the publication date in YYYY-MM-DD</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> --system <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>extract people mentioned in this article<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>The <code>--schema-multi</code> option here tells LLM to take that schema for a single object and upgrade it to an array of those objects (actually an object with a single <code>\"items\"</code> property that's an array of objects), which is a quick way to request that the same schema be returned multiple times against a single input.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reusing-schemas-and-creating-templates\">Reusing schemas and creating templates</h4>\n<p>My original plan with schemas was to provide a separate <code>llm extract</code> command for running these kinds of operations. I ended up going in a different direction - I realized that adding <code>--schema</code> to the default <code>llm prompt</code> command would make it interoperable with other existing features (like <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/usage.html#attachments\">attachments</a> for feeding in images and PDFs).</p>\n<p>The most valuable way to apply schemas is across many different prompts, in order to gather the same structure of information from many different sources.</p>\n<p>I put a bunch of thought into the <code>--schema</code> option. It takes a variety of different values - quoting <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/schemas.html#ways-to-specify-a-schema\">the documentation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This option can take multiple forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A string providing a JSON schema: <code>--schema '{\"type\": \"object\", ...}'</code>\n</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/schemas.html#schemas-dsl\">condensed schema definition</a>: <code>--schema 'name,age int'</code>\n</li>\n<li>The name or path of a file on disk containing a JSON schema: <code>--schema dogs.schema.json</code>\n</li>\n<li>The hexadecimal ID of a previously logged schema: <code>--schema 520f7aabb121afd14d0c6c237b39ba2d</code> - these IDs can be found using the <code>llm schemas</code> command.</li>\n<li>A schema that has been <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/templates.html#prompt-templates-save\">saved in a template</a>: <code>--schema t:name-of-template</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/schemas.html#extracting-people-from-a-news-articles\">tutorial</a> demonstrates saving a schema by using it once and then obtaining its ID through the new <code>llm schemas</code> command, then saving it to a <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html\">template</a> (along with the system prompt) like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm --schema 3b7702e71da3dd791d9e17b76c88730e \\\n  --system <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>extract people mentioned in this article<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> \\\n  --save people</pre></div>\n<p>And now we can feed in new articles using the <code>llm -t people</code> shortcut to apply that newly saved template:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>curl https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/27/billy-mcfarland-new-fyre-festival-fantasist <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> \\\n  strip-tags <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> llm -t people</pre></div>\n<h4 id=\"doing-more-with-the-logged-structured-data\">Doing more with the logged structured data</h4>\n<p>Having run a few prompts that use the same schema, an obvious next step is to do something with the data that has been collected.</p>\n<p>I ended up implementing this on top of the existing <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html\">llm logs</a> mechanism.</p>\n<p>LLM already defaults to logging every prompt and response it makes to a SQLite database - mine contains over 4,747 of these records now, according to this query:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>sqlite3 <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span><span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">$(</span>llm logs path<span class=\"pl-pds\">)</span></span><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>select count(*) from responses<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>With schemas, an increasing portion of those are valid JSON.</p>\n<p>Since LLM records the schema that was used for each response - using the schema ID, which is derived from a content hash of the expanded JSON schema - it's now possible to ask LLM for all responses that used a particular schema:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm logs --schema 3b7702e71da3dd791d9e17b76c88730e --short</pre></div>\n<p>I got back:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-yaml\"><pre>- <span class=\"pl-ent\">model</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">gpt-4o-mini</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">datetime</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>2025-02-28T07:37:18<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">conversation</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">01jn5qt397aaxskf1vjp6zxw2a</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">system</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">extract people mentioned in this article</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">prompt</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Menu AP Logo Menu World U.S. Politics Sports Entertainment Business Science</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-s\">Fact Check Oddities Be Well Newsletters N...</span>\n- <span class=\"pl-ent\">model</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">gpt-4o-mini</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">datetime</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>2025-02-28T07:38:58<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">conversation</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">01jn5qx4q5he7yq803rnexp28p</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">system</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">extract people mentioned in this article</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">prompt</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Skip to main contentSkip to navigationSkip to navigationPrint subscriptionsNewsletters</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-s\">Sign inUSUS editionUK editionA...</span>\n- <span class=\"pl-ent\">model</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">gpt-4o</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">datetime</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>2025-02-28T07:39:07<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">conversation</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">01jn5qxh20tksb85tf3bx2m3bd</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">system</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">extract people mentioned in this article</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">attachments</span>:\n  -

twice against text content from <code>curl ... | strip-tags</code> and once against <a href=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/onion-zuck.jpg\">a screenshot JPEG</a> to demonstrate attachment support.</p>\n<p>Extracting gathered JSON from the logs is clearly a useful next step... so I added several options to <code>llm logs</code> to support that use-case.</p>\n<p>The first is <code>--data</code> - adding that will cause <code>LLM logs</code> to output just the data that was gathered using a schema. Mix that with <code>-c</code> to see the JSON from the most recent response:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm logs -c --data</pre></div>\n<p>Outputs:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-json\"><pre>{<span class=\"pl-ent\">\"name\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Zap<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"age\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">5</span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"short_bio\"</span>: ...</pre></div>\n<p>Combining that with the <code>--schema</code> option is where things get really interesting. You can specify a schema using any of the mechanisms described earlier, which means you can see ALL of the data gathered using that schema by combining <code>--data</code> with <code>--schema X</code> (and <code>-n 0</code> for everything).</p>\n<p>Here are all of the dogs I've invented:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm logs --schema <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>name,age int,short_bio<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> --data -n 0</pre></div>\n<p>Output (here truncated):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-json\"><pre>{<span class=\"pl-ent\">\"name\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Zap<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"age\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">5</span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"short_bio\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Zap is a futuristic ...<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>}\n{<span class=\"pl-ent\">\"name\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Zephyr<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"age\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">3</span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"short_bio\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Zephyr is an adventurous...<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>}\n{<span class=\"pl-ent\">\"name\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Zylo<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"age\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">4</span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"short_bio\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Zylo is a unique ...<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>}</pre></div>\n<p>Some schemas gather multiple items, producing output that looks like this (from the tutorial):</p>\n<pre><code>{\"items\": [{\"name\": \"Mark Zuckerberg\", \"organization\": \"...\n{\"items\": [{\"name\": \"Billy McFarland\", \"organization\": \"...\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can get back the individual objects by adding <code>--data-key items</code>.

That's the trick where you feed an LLM an article, or a PDF, or a screenshot and use it to turn that into JSON or CSV or some other structured format.</p>\n<p>It's possible to achieve strong results on this with prompting alone: feed data into an LLM, give it an example of the output you would like and let it figure out the details.</p>\n<p>Many of the leading LLM providers now bake this in as a feature. OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and Mistral all offer variants of \"structured output\" as additional options through their API:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OpenAI: <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs\">Structured Outputs</a>\n</li>\n<li>Gemini: <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output?lang=rest\">Generate structured output with the Gemini API</a>\n</li>\n<li>Mistral: <a href=\"https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/structured-output/custom_structured_output/\">Custom Structured Outputs</a>\n</li>\n<li>Anthropic's <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use/overview\">tool use</a> can be used for this, as shown in their <a href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/tool_use/extracting_structured_json.ipynb\">Extracting Structured JSON using Claude and Tool Use</a> cookbook example.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These mechanisms are all very similar: you pass a <a href=\"https://json-schema.org/\">JSON schema</a> to the model defining the shape that you would like, they then use that schema to guide the output of the model.</p>\n<p>How reliable that is can vary! Some providers use tricks along the lines of <a href=\"https://github.com/1rgs/jsonformer\">Jsonformer</a>, compiling the JSON schema into code that interacts with the model's next-token generation at runtime, limiting it to only generate tokens that are valid in the context of the schema.</p>\n<p>Other providers YOLO it - they trust that their model is \"good enough\" that showing it the schema will produce the right results!</p>\n<p>In practice, this means that you need to be aware that sometimes this stuff will go wrong. As with anything LLM, 100% reliability is never guaranteed.</p>\n<p>From my experiments so far, and depending on the model that you chose, these mistakes are rare. If you're using a top tier model it will almost certainly do the right thing.</p>\n<h4 id=\"designing-this-feature-for-llm\">Designing this feature for LLM</h4>\n<p>I've wanted this feature for ages. I see it as an important step on the way to full tool usage, which is something I'm very excited to bring to the CLI tool and Python library.</p>\n<p>LLM is designed as an abstraction layer over different models. This makes building new features <em>much harder</em>, because I need to figure out a common denominator and then build an abstraction that captures as much value as possible while still being general enough to work across multiple models.</p>\n<p>Support for structured output across multiple vendors has matured now to the point that I'm ready to commit to a design.</p>\n<p>My first version of this feature worked exclusively with JSON schemas. An earlier version of the tutorial started with this example:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>curl https://www.nytimes.com/ <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> uvx strip-tags <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> \\\n  llm --schema <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>{</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">  \"type\": \"object\",</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">  \"properties\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">    \"items\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">      \"type\": \"array\",</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">      \"items\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">        \"type\": \"object\",</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">        \"properties\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          \"headline\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">            \"type\": \"string\"</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          },</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          \"short_summary\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">            \"type\": \"string\"</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          },</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          \"key_points\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">            \"type\": \"array\",</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">            \"items\": {</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">              \"type\": \"string\"</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">            }</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">          }</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">        },</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">        \"required\": [\"headline\", \"short_summary\", \"key_points\"]</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">      }</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">    }</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">  },</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">  \"required\": [\"items\"]</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">}<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> jq</pre></div>\n<p>Here we're feeding a full JSON schema document to the new <code>llm --schema</code> option, then piping in the homepage of the New York Times (after running it through <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/strip-tags\">strip-tags</a>) and asking for <code>headline</code>, <code>short_summary</code> and <code>key_points</code> for multiple items on the page.</p>\n<p>This example still works with the finished feature - you can see <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/372d11e2729a9745654740ff3f5669ab\">example JSON output here</a> - but constructing those long-form schemas by hand was a big pain.</p>\n<p>So... I invented my own shortcut syntax.</p>\n<p>That earlier example is a simple illustration:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm --schema <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>name,age int,short_bio<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>invent a cool dog<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Here the schema is a comma-separated list of field names, with an optional space-separated type.</p>\n<p>The full concise schema syntax <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/schemas.html#concise-llm-schema-syntax\">is described here</a>. There's a more complex example <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/schemas.html#extracting-people-from-a-news-articles\">in the tutorial</a>, which uses the newline-delimited form to extract information about people who are mentioned in a news article:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>curl <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>https://apnews.com/article/trump-federal-employees-firings-a85d1aaf1088e050d39dcf7e3664bb9f<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> \\\n  uvx strip-tags <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> \\\n  llm --schema-multi <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">name: the person's name</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">organization: who they represent</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">role: their job title or role</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">learned: what we learned about them from this story</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">article_headline: the headline of the story</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">article_date: the publication date in YYYY-MM-DD</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> --system <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>extract people mentioned in this article<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>The <code>--schema-multi</code> option here tells LLM to take that schema for a single object and upgrade it to an array of those objects (actually an object with a single <code>\"items\"</code> property that's an array of objects), which is a quick way to request that the same schema be returned multiple times against a single input.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reusing-schemas-and-creating-templates\">Reusing schemas and creating templates</h4>\n<p>My original plan with schemas was to provide a separate <code>llm extract</code> command for running these kinds of operations. I ended up going in a different direction - I realized that adding <code>--schema</code> to the default <code>llm prompt</code> command would make it interoperable with other existing features (like <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/usage.html#attachments\">attachments</a> for feeding in images and PDFs).</p>\n<p>The most valuable way to apply schemas is across many different prompts, in order to gather the same structure of information from many different sources.</p>\n<p>I put a bunch of thought into the <code>--schema</code> option. It takes a variety of different values - quoting <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/schemas.html#ways-to-specify-a-schema\">the documentation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This option can take multiple forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A string providing a JSON schema: <code>--schema '{\"type\": \"object\", ...}'</code>\n</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/schemas.html#schemas-dsl\">condensed schema definition</a>: <code>--schema 'name,age int'</code>\n</li>\n<li>The name or path of a file on disk containing a JSON schema: <code>--schema dogs.schema.json</code>\n</li>\n<li>The hexadecimal ID of a previously logged schema: <code>--schema 520f7aabb121afd14d0c6c237b39ba2d</code> - these IDs can be found using the <code>llm schemas</code> command.</li>\n<li>A schema that has been <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/templates.html#prompt-templates-save\">saved in a template</a>: <code>--schema t:name-of-template</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/schemas.html#extracting-people-from-a-news-articles\">tutorial</a> demonstrates saving a schema by using it once and then obtaining its ID through the new <code>llm schemas</code> command, then saving it to a <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html\">template</a> (along with the system prompt) like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm --schema 3b7702e71da3dd791d9e17b76c88730e \\\n  --system <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>extract people mentioned in this article<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> \\\n  --save people</pre></div>\n<p>And now we can feed in new articles using the <code>llm -t people</code> shortcut to apply that newly saved template:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>curl https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/27/billy-mcfarland-new-fyre-festival-fantasist <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> \\\n  strip-tags <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> llm -t people</pre></div>\n<h4 id=\"doing-more-with-the-logged-structured-data\">Doing more with the logged structured data</h4>\n<p>Having run a few prompts that use the same schema, an obvious next step is to do something with the data that has been collected.</p>\n<p>I ended up implementing this on top of the existing <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html\">llm logs</a> mechanism.</p>\n<p>LLM already defaults to logging every prompt and response it makes to a SQLite database - mine contains over 4,747 of these records now, according to this query:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>sqlite3 <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span><span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">$(</span>llm logs path<span class=\"pl-pds\">)</span></span><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>select count(*) from responses<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>With schemas, an increasing portion of those are valid JSON.</p>\n<p>Since LLM records the schema that was used for each response - using the schema ID, which is derived from a content hash of the expanded JSON schema - it's now possible to ask LLM for all responses that used a particular schema:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm logs --schema 3b7702e71da3dd791d9e17b76c88730e --short</pre></div>\n<p>I got back:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-yaml\"><pre>- <span class=\"pl-ent\">model</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">gpt-4o-mini</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">datetime</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>2025-02-28T07:37:18<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">conversation</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">01jn5qt397aaxskf1vjp6zxw2a</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">system</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">extract people mentioned in this article</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">prompt</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Menu AP Logo Menu World U.S. Politics Sports Entertainment Business Science</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-s\">Fact Check Oddities Be Well Newsletters N...</span>\n- <span class=\"pl-ent\">model</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">gpt-4o-mini</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">datetime</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>2025-02-28T07:38:58<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">conversation</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">01jn5qx4q5he7yq803rnexp28p</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">system</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">extract people mentioned in this article</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">prompt</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">Skip to main contentSkip to navigationSkip to navigationPrint subscriptionsNewsletters</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-s\">Sign inUSUS editionUK editionA...</span>\n- <span class=\"pl-ent\">model</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">gpt-4o</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">datetime</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>2025-02-28T07:39:07<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">conversation</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">01jn5qxh20tksb85tf3bx2m3bd</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">system</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">extract people mentioned in this article</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">attachments</span>:\n  -

twice against text content from <code>curl ... | strip-tags</code> and once against <a href=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/onion-zuck.jpg\">a screenshot JPEG</a> to demonstrate attachment support.</p>\n<p>Extracting gathered JSON from the logs is clearly a useful next step... so I added several options to <code>llm logs</code> to support that use-case.</p>\n<p>The first is <code>--data</code> - adding that will cause <code>LLM logs</code> to output just the data that was gathered using a schema. Mix that with <code>-c</code> to see the JSON from the most recent response:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm logs -c --data</pre></div>\n<p>Outputs:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-json\"><pre>{<span class=\"pl-ent\">\"name\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Zap<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"age\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">5</span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"short_bio\"</span>: ...</pre></div>\n<p>Combining that with the <code>--schema</code> option is where things get really interesting. You can specify a schema using any of the mechanisms described earlier, which means you can see ALL of the data gathered using that schema by combining <code>--data</code> with <code>--schema X</code> (and <code>-n 0</code> for everything).</p>\n<p>Here are all of the dogs I've invented:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm logs --schema <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>name,age int,short_bio<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> --data -n 0</pre></div>\n<p>Output (here truncated):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-json\"><pre>{<span class=\"pl-ent\">\"name\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Zap<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"age\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">5</span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"short_bio\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Zap is a futuristic ...<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>}\n{<span class=\"pl-ent\">\"name\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Zephyr<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"age\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">3</span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"short_bio\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Zephyr is an adventurous...<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>}\n{<span class=\"pl-ent\">\"name\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Zylo<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"age\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">4</span>, <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"short_bio\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>Zylo is a unique ...<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>}</pre></div>\n<p>Some schemas gather multiple items, producing output that looks like this (from the tutorial):</p>\n<pre><code>{\"items\": [{\"name\": \"Mark Zuckerberg\", \"organization\": \"...\n{\"items\": [{\"name\": \"Billy McFarland\", \"organization\": \"...\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can get back the individual objects by adding <code>--data-key items</code>.

I released <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/releases/tag/0.14\">llm-anthropic 0.14</a> last night adding support for the new model's features to <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/\">LLM</a>. I learned a whole lot about the new model in the process of building that plugin.</p>\n<p>The base Claude 3.7 Sonnet model mostly feels like an incremental improvement over the excellent Claude 3.5 Sonnet. It benchmarks better and my vibe checks so far are good: it writes excellent code across Python and JavaScript and seems to do everything 3.5 did, for the same price but with an uptick in overall quality.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/25/llm-anthropic-014/#extended-thinking-mode\">Extended thinking mode</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/25/llm-anthropic-014/#running-thinking-prompts\">Running thinking prompts</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/25/llm-anthropic-014/#llm-anthropic-doesn-t-support-visible-thinking-tokens-yet\">llm-anthropic doesn't support visible thinking tokens yet</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/25/llm-anthropic-014/#a-massively-increased-output-limit\">A massively increased output limit</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/25/llm-anthropic-014/#everything-else-in-the-plugin-release\">Everything else in the plugin release</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"extended-thinking-mode\">Extended thinking mode</h4>\n<p>The <strong>big</strong> new feature is <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking\">extended thinking</a> mode. This is the option that turns Claude into an <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/inference-scaling/\">inference scaling</a> model similar to OpenAI's o1 and o3, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking and DeepSeek R1.</p>\n<p>From my plugin's release notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for the new <strong>Claude 3.7 Sonnet</strong> model, including <code>-o thinking 1</code> to turn on <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking\">extended thinking</a> mode and <code>-o thinking_budget X</code> to increase the thinking token budget from the 1024 default. <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/issues/14\">#14</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You need to opt-in to this new mode. In the Claude API that means appending this block of JSON to your request:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-json\"><pre>{\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"thinking\"</span>: {\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"type\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>enabled<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>,\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"budget_tokens\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">1024</span>\n    }\n}</pre></div>\n<p>The <code>budget_tokens</code> defines how many tokens Claude can spend \"thinking\" about your prompt. 1,024 is the minimum, but you can increase that up to a maximum of 128,000 (see below).</p>\n<p>This is Claude's equivalent of OpenAI's <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning#reasoning-effort\">reasoning_effort</a> option, which can be set to low, medium (the default) or high.</p>\n<h4 id=\"running-thinking-prompts\">Running thinking prompts</h4>\n<p>You can run a \"thinking\" prompt through LLM like this - the new <code>-o thinking 1</code> option switches on the new extended thinking mode:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm install -U llm-anthropic\nllm -m claude-3.7-sonnet -o thinking 1 <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>write a speech about pelicans for congress<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>The <code>-o thinking_budget 4000</code> option can increase the number of allowed thinking tokens from the default value of 1024.</p>\n<p>For the moment the thinking tokens are not visible - but you can review them once the prompt has completed using the <code>llm logs --json</code> command:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm logs --json -c</pre></div>\n<p>The <code>-c</code> option is inherited from \"continue previous conversation\" - it will show the log for the most recently completed prompt.</p>\n<p>You can see <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/116e3c0cc7dba5446dbd587c6fc6147d\">the speech about pelicans</a> here, but here's the more interesting thought process that was output by the model:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm being asked to write a speech about pelicans that would be delivered to Congress. This seems like an unusual request, but I can craft a formal, informative speech that might be given by someone advocating for pelican conservation, environmental protection, or perhaps using pelicans as a symbol for some broader policy discussion.</p>\n<p>The speech should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be formal and appropriate for Congress</li>\n<li>Contain factual information about pelicans</li>\n<li>Have a clear purpose (likely conservation-related)</li>\n<li>Include rhetorical elements typical of congressional speeches</li>\n<li>Maintain a respectful, bipartisan tone</li>\n<li>Perhaps connect pelicans to broader environmental policies or American values</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'll write a speech that could plausibly be given by a member of Congress, a cabinet secretary (like the Secretary of the Interior), or an expert testifying before a congressional committee about environmental matters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unlike OpenAI, Anthropic chose not to obscure the thinking tokens - what you see is what the model used. There's one interesting edge-case described in their detailed documentation <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#understanding-thinking-blocks\">about the extended thinking API output</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Occasionally Claude's internal reasoning will be flagged by our safety systems. When this occurs, we encrypt some or all of the <code>thinking</code> block and return it to you as a <code>redacted_thinking</code> block. These redacted thinking blocks are decrypted when passed back to the API, allowing Claude to continue its response without losing context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"llm-anthropic-doesn-t-support-visible-thinking-tokens-yet\">llm-anthropic doesn't support visible thinking tokens yet</h4>\n<p>I had a couple of attempts at implementing this. My <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/pull/15\">first try</a> included options to make the thinking tokens visible as the tool was running. This turned out to involve unexpected challenges: the rest of LLM doesn't yet understand that some tokens should be treated differently, and I quickly ran into challenges concerning how those responses were logged to the database.</p>\n<p>In the interests of getting support for the new model out I simplified my approach. I plan to add visible thinking tokens <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/770\">in a future LLM release</a>.</p>\n<p>This is part of a larger challenge for LLM described in this issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/716\">Design annotations abstraction for responses that are not just a stream of plain text</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"a-massively-increased-output-limit\">A massively increased output limit</h4>\n<p>A fascinating new capability of Claude 3.7 Sonnet is that its output limit in extended thinking mode can be extended to an extraordinary <strong>128,000 tokens</strong> - 15x more than the previous Claude output limit of 8,192 tokens.</p>\n<p>(This is the <strong>output limit</strong> - how much text it can produce in one go. Claude 3.7 Sonnet's input limit remains 200,000 - many modern models exceed 100,000 for input now.)</p>\n<p>I added support for that to the plugin as well - if you pass <code>-o max_output 128000</code> it automatically calls Anthropic's beta API with the <code>output-128k-2025-02-19</code> beta header, <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#extended-output-capabilities-beta\">documented here</a>.</p>\n<p>Testing this was pretty hard! I eventually <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/pull/18#issuecomment-2680946698\">found a prompt</a> that exercised this fully:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm -m claude-3.7-sonnet \\\n  -o max_tokens 128000 \\\n  -o thinking_budget 32000 \\\n  <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>For every one of the 100 US senators that you know of output their name, biography and a note about how to strategically convince them to take more interest in the plight of the California Brown Pelican, then a poem about them, then that same poem translated to Spanish and then to Japanese. Do not miss any senators.<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> \\\n  -s <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>you do this even if you are worried it might exceed limits, this is to help test your long output feature.<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>This is an expensive command to run - the resulting prompt cost me $1.72 and took nearly 27 minutes to finish returning the answer! You can see <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/854474b050b630144beebf06ec4a2f52\">the full 114,584 token output here</a> - it managed to output results for all 100 senators as of its training cut-off date, correctly following my instructions for each one.</p>\n<p>This is one of the few cases where I've felt guilty about <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/#the-environmental-impact-got-better\">the energy usage of my prompts</a> - burning GPUs for 27 minutes feels like it's a genuinely significant use of resources!</p>\n<p>Anthropic recommend <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips#technical-considerations-for-extended-thinking\">using batch mode</a> for long prompts like this, which comes with a 50% discount presumably as it runs on GPUs that happen to have spare capacity. This can be quite performant: <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing#batch-limitations\">Anthropic say</a> \"We process each batch as fast as possible, with most batches completing within 1 hour\".</p>\n<p>I find the end result of my long test prompt to be <em>very</em> impressive. A common complaint I've seen about LLMs is that they tend to fail when you ask them to perform comprehensive tasks like this - things where they need to curate information across a larger number of distinct items. This feels intuitively like the kind of thing a computer should be good at but most models make mistakes or hallucinate when challenged in this way.</p>\n<p>Claude 3.7 Sonnet really did manage to output correct text across all 100 US senators, albeit limited by the new model's October/Nov 2024 <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/all-models#model-comparison-table\">training cut-off date</a>.</p>\n<p>The extended output limit is notable as well. Most models are still limited to 4,000 or 8,000 characters - 120,000 is a huge leap forward.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> I was wrong about that: OpenAI's <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#o1\">o1 and o3-mini</a> both have a 100,000 output token limit now.</em></p>\n<p>I mentioned that my prompt took 27 minutes to run. On further inspection of my logs it looks like this is expected - Claude 3.7 Sonnet appears to take around 14ms per output token, and 14 * 114584 = 1604176 ms which is 1604 seconds or around 26.7 minutes. This is a downside of longer outputs I had not previously considered!</p>\n<h4 id=\"everything-else-in-the-plugin-release\">Everything else in the plugin release</h4>\n<p>There are a few smaller changes in the new plugin release:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Claude 3.5 Haiku now supports image inputs. <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/issues/17\">#17</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is tucked away in Anthropic's <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/api#february-24th-2025\">February 24th 2025 release notes</a>. Previously their less expensive 3.5 Haiku model couldn't handle images - the only modern Claude model without that ability. They've fixed that now.</p>\n<p>The rest of the changes in the 0.14 release are bug fixes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug that occurred when continuing an existing conversation using <code>--async</code> mode. <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/issues/13\">#13</a>\n</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where <code>max_tokens</code> and <code>temperature</code> were logged in the database even when using their default options. <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/issues/16\">#16</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",

I released <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/releases/tag/0.14\">llm-anthropic 0.14</a> last night adding support for the new model's features to <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/\">LLM</a>. I learned a whole lot about the new model in the process of building that plugin.</p>\n<p>The base Claude 3.7 Sonnet model mostly feels like an incremental improvement over the excellent Claude 3.5 Sonnet. It benchmarks better and my vibe checks so far are good: it writes excellent code across Python and JavaScript and seems to do everything 3.5 did, for the same price but with an uptick in overall quality.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/25/llm-anthropic-014/#extended-thinking-mode\">Extended thinking mode</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/25/llm-anthropic-014/#running-thinking-prompts\">Running thinking prompts</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/25/llm-anthropic-014/#llm-anthropic-doesn-t-support-visible-thinking-tokens-yet\">llm-anthropic doesn't support visible thinking tokens yet</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/25/llm-anthropic-014/#a-massively-increased-output-limit\">A massively increased output limit</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/25/llm-anthropic-014/#everything-else-in-the-plugin-release\">Everything else in the plugin release</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"extended-thinking-mode\">Extended thinking mode</h4>\n<p>The <strong>big</strong> new feature is <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking\">extended thinking</a> mode. This is the option that turns Claude into an <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/inference-scaling/\">inference scaling</a> model similar to OpenAI's o1 and o3, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking and DeepSeek R1.</p>\n<p>From my plugin's release notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for the new <strong>Claude 3.7 Sonnet</strong> model, including <code>-o thinking 1</code> to turn on <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking\">extended thinking</a> mode and <code>-o thinking_budget X</code> to increase the thinking token budget from the 1024 default. <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/issues/14\">#14</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You need to opt-in to this new mode. In the Claude API that means appending this block of JSON to your request:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-json\"><pre>{\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"thinking\"</span>: {\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"type\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>enabled<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>,\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"budget_tokens\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">1024</span>\n    }\n}</pre></div>\n<p>The <code>budget_tokens</code> defines how many tokens Claude can spend \"thinking\" about your prompt. 1,024 is the minimum, but you can increase that up to a maximum of 128,000 (see below).</p>\n<p>This is Claude's equivalent of OpenAI's <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning#reasoning-effort\">reasoning_effort</a> option, which can be set to low, medium (the default) or high.</p>\n<h4 id=\"running-thinking-prompts\">Running thinking prompts</h4>\n<p>You can run a \"thinking\" prompt through LLM like this - the new <code>-o thinking 1</code> option switches on the new extended thinking mode:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm install -U llm-anthropic\nllm -m claude-3.7-sonnet -o thinking 1 <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>write a speech about pelicans for congress<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>The <code>-o thinking_budget 4000</code> option can increase the number of allowed thinking tokens from the default value of 1024.</p>\n<p>For the moment the thinking tokens are not visible - but you can review them once the prompt has completed using the <code>llm logs --json</code> command:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm logs --json -c</pre></div>\n<p>The <code>-c</code> option is inherited from \"continue previous conversation\" - it will show the log for the most recently completed prompt.</p>\n<p>You can see <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/116e3c0cc7dba5446dbd587c6fc6147d\">the speech about pelicans</a> here, but here's the more interesting thought process that was output by the model:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm being asked to write a speech about pelicans that would be delivered to Congress. This seems like an unusual request, but I can craft a formal, informative speech that might be given by someone advocating for pelican conservation, environmental protection, or perhaps using pelicans as a symbol for some broader policy discussion.</p>\n<p>The speech should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be formal and appropriate for Congress</li>\n<li>Contain factual information about pelicans</li>\n<li>Have a clear purpose (likely conservation-related)</li>\n<li>Include rhetorical elements typical of congressional speeches</li>\n<li>Maintain a respectful, bipartisan tone</li>\n<li>Perhaps connect pelicans to broader environmental policies or American values</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'll write a speech that could plausibly be given by a member of Congress, a cabinet secretary (like the Secretary of the Interior), or an expert testifying before a congressional committee about environmental matters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unlike OpenAI, Anthropic chose not to obscure the thinking tokens - what you see is what the model used. There's one interesting edge-case described in their detailed documentation <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#understanding-thinking-blocks\">about the extended thinking API output</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Occasionally Claude's internal reasoning will be flagged by our safety systems. When this occurs, we encrypt some or all of the <code>thinking</code> block and return it to you as a <code>redacted_thinking</code> block. These redacted thinking blocks are decrypted when passed back to the API, allowing Claude to continue its response without losing context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"llm-anthropic-doesn-t-support-visible-thinking-tokens-yet\">llm-anthropic doesn't support visible thinking tokens yet</h4>\n<p>I had a couple of attempts at implementing this. My <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/pull/15\">first try</a> included options to make the thinking tokens visible as the tool was running. This turned out to involve unexpected challenges: the rest of LLM doesn't yet understand that some tokens should be treated differently, and I quickly ran into challenges concerning how those responses were logged to the database.</p>\n<p>In the interests of getting support for the new model out I simplified my approach. I plan to add visible thinking tokens <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/770\">in a future LLM release</a>.</p>\n<p>This is part of a larger challenge for LLM described in this issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/716\">Design annotations abstraction for responses that are not just a stream of plain text</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"a-massively-increased-output-limit\">A massively increased output limit</h4>\n<p>A fascinating new capability of Claude 3.7 Sonnet is that its output limit in extended thinking mode can be extended to an extraordinary <strong>128,000 tokens</strong> - 15x more than the previous Claude output limit of 8,192 tokens.</p>\n<p>(This is the <strong>output limit</strong> - how much text it can produce in one go. Claude 3.7 Sonnet's input limit remains 200,000 - many modern models exceed 100,000 for input now.)</p>\n<p>I added support for that to the plugin as well - if you pass <code>-o max_output 128000</code> it automatically calls Anthropic's beta API with the <code>output-128k-2025-02-19</code> beta header, <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#extended-output-capabilities-beta\">documented here</a>.</p>\n<p>Testing this was pretty hard! I eventually <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/pull/18#issuecomment-2680946698\">found a prompt</a> that exercised this fully:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>llm -m claude-3.7-sonnet \\\n  -o max_tokens 128000 \\\n  -o thinking_budget 32000 \\\n  <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>For every one of the 100 US senators that you know of output their name, biography and a note about how to strategically convince them to take more interest in the plight of the California Brown Pelican, then a poem about them, then that same poem translated to Spanish and then to Japanese. Do not miss any senators.<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> \\\n  -s <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>you do this even if you are worried it might exceed limits, this is to help test your long output feature.<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>This is an expensive command to run - the resulting prompt cost me $1.72 and took nearly 27 minutes to finish returning the answer! You can see <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/854474b050b630144beebf06ec4a2f52\">the full 114,584 token output here</a> - it managed to output results for all 100 senators as of its training cut-off date, correctly following my instructions for each one.</p>\n<p>This is one of the few cases where I've felt guilty about <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/#the-environmental-impact-got-better\">the energy usage of my prompts</a> - burning GPUs for 27 minutes feels like it's a genuinely significant use of resources!</p>\n<p>Anthropic recommend <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips#technical-considerations-for-extended-thinking\">using batch mode</a> for long prompts like this, which comes with a 50% discount presumably as it runs on GPUs that happen to have spare capacity. This can be quite performant: <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing#batch-limitations\">Anthropic say</a> \"We process each batch as fast as possible, with most batches completing within 1 hour\".</p>\n<p>I find the end result of my long test prompt to be <em>very</em> impressive. A common complaint I've seen about LLMs is that they tend to fail when you ask them to perform comprehensive tasks like this - things where they need to curate information across a larger number of distinct items. This feels intuitively like the kind of thing a computer should be good at but most models make mistakes or hallucinate when challenged in this way.</p>\n<p>Claude 3.7 Sonnet really did manage to output correct text across all 100 US senators, albeit limited by the new model's October/Nov 2024 <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/all-models#model-comparison-table\">training cut-off date</a>.</p>\n<p>The extended output limit is notable as well. Most models are still limited to 4,000 or 8,000 characters - 120,000 is a huge leap forward.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> I was wrong about that: OpenAI's <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#o1\">o1 and o3-mini</a> both have a 100,000 output token limit now.</em></p>\n<p>I mentioned that my prompt took 27 minutes to run. On further inspection of my logs it looks like this is expected - Claude 3.7 Sonnet appears to take around 14ms per output token, and 14 * 114584 = 1604176 ms which is 1604 seconds or around 26.7 minutes. This is a downside of longer outputs I had not previously considered!</p>\n<h4 id=\"everything-else-in-the-plugin-release\">Everything else in the plugin release</h4>\n<p>There are a few smaller changes in the new plugin release:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Claude 3.5 Haiku now supports image inputs. <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/issues/17\">#17</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is tucked away in Anthropic's <a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/api#february-24th-2025\">February 24th 2025 release notes</a>. Previously their less expensive 3.5 Haiku model couldn't handle images - the only modern Claude model without that ability. They've fixed that now.</p>\n<p>The rest of the changes in the 0.14 release are bug fixes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug that occurred when continuing an existing conversation using <code>--async</code> mode. <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/issues/13\">#13</a>\n</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where <code>max_tokens</code> and <code>temperature</code> were logged in the database even when using their default options. <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/issues/16\">#16</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>"

This results in the API key being passed as a new <code>key</code> parameter to their <code>.execute()</code> methods, and means that Python users can pass a key as the <code>model.prompt(..., key=)</code> - see <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-models-api-keys\">Passing an API key</a>. Plugin developers should consult the new documentation on writing <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/advanced-model-plugins.html#advanced-model-plugins-api-keys\">Models that accept API keys</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/744\">#744</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the big change. It's only relevant to you if you use LLM as a Python library <em>and</em> you need the ability to pass API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini etc in yourself in Python code rather than setting them as an environment variable.</p>\n<p>It turns out I need to do that for Datasette Cloud, where API keys are retrieved from individual customer's secret stores!</p>\n<p>Thanks to this change, it's now possible to do things like this - the <code>key=</code> parameter to <code>model.prompt()</code> is new:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"pl-k\">import</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">llm</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s1\">model</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">llm</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">get_model</span>(<span class=\"pl-s\">\"gpt-4o-mini\"</span>)\n<span class=\"pl-s1\">response</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">model</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">prompt</span>(<span class=\"pl-s\">\"Surprise me!\"</span>, <span class=\"pl-s1\">key</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\"my-api-key\"</span>)\n<span class=\"pl-en\">print</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">response</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">text</span>())</pre>\n<p>Other plugins need to be updated to take advantage of this new feature. Here's <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/advanced-model-plugins.html#models-that-accept-api-keys\">the documentation for plugin developers</a> - I've released <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/releases/tag/0.13\">llm-anthropic 0.13</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.11\">llm-gemini 0.11</a> implementing the new pattern.</p>\n<h4 id=\"chatgpt-4o-latest\">chatgpt-4o-latest</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>New OpenAI model: <code>chatgpt-4o-latest</code>. This model ID accesses the current model being used to power ChatGPT, which can change without warning. <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/752\">#752</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This model has actually been around since <a href=\"https://twitter.com/openaidevs/status/1823510395619000525\">August 2024</a> but I had somehow missed it. <code>chatgpt-4o-latest</code> is a model alias that provides access to the current model that is being used for GPT-4o running on ChatGPT, which is <em>not</em> the same as the GPT-4o models usually available via the API. It got <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edwinarbus/status/1890841371675619728\">an upgrade</a> last week so it's currently the alias that provides access to the most recently released OpenAI model.</p>\n<p>Most OpenAI models such as <code>gpt-4o</code> provide stable date-based aliases like <code>gpt-4o-2024-08-06</code> which effectively let you \"pin\" to that exact model version.

This results in the API key being passed as a new <code>key</code> parameter to their <code>.execute()</code> methods, and means that Python users can pass a key as the <code>model.prompt(..., key=)</code> - see <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-models-api-keys\">Passing an API key</a>.

It's only relevant to you if you use LLM as a Python library <em>and</em> you need the ability to pass API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini etc in yourself in Python code rather than setting them as an environment variable.</p>\n<p>It turns out I need to do that for Datasette Cloud, where API keys are retrieved from individual customer's secret stores!</p>\n<p>Thanks to this change, it's now possible to do things like this - the <code>key=</code> parameter to <code>model.prompt()</code> is new:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"pl-k\">import</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">llm</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s1\">model</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">llm</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">get_model</span>(<span class=\"pl-s\">\"gpt-4o-mini\"</span>)\n<span class=\"pl-s1\">response</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">model</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">prompt</span>(<span class=\"pl-s\">\"Surprise me!\"</span>, <span class=\"pl-s1\">key</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\"my-api-key\"</span>)\n<span class=\"pl-en\">print</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">response</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">text</span>())</pre>\n<p>Other plugins need to be updated to take advantage of this new feature.

Here's how to get it to explain a piece of Python code (in this case <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx/blob/0.2/llm_mlx.py\">itself</a>):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>cat llm_mlx.py <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> llm -m l32 <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>explain this code<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span></pre></div>\n<p>The response started like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This code is a part of a larger project that uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to create a text-to-text conversational AI model.

I'm pretty amazed at how well it did for a tiny 1.8GB model!</p>\n\n<p>This plugin can only run models that have been converted to work with Apple's MLX framework. Thankfully the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/mlx-community\">mlx-community</a> organization on Hugging Face has published over 1,000 of these.

I'm particularly impressed by Prince Canuma's <a href=\"https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm\">mlx-vlm</a> library for accessing multi-modal vision LLMs - I'd love to get that working as an LLM plugin once I figure out <a href=\"https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm/issues/68\">how to use it for conversations</a>.</p>\n<p>I've used MLX for <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/mlx/\">a few experiments</a> in the past, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/1890524526821126620\">this tweet</a> from MLX core developer Awni Hannun finally convinced me to wrap it up as an LLM plugin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the latest MLX small LLMs are a lot faster.</p>\n<p>On M4 Max 4-bit Qwen 0.5B generates 1k tokens at a whopping 510 toks/sec. And runs at over 150 tok/sec on iPhone 16 pro.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is <em>really</em> good software.

I figure it's a good opportunity to highlight how useful it is to have a URL-addressable Python environment, powered by Pyodide and WebAssembly.</p>\n<p>Here's the page that helped me discover the bug:</p>\n<p><code><a href=\"https://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-visible-internal-db&amp;ref=1.0a17#/_internal/catalog_columns?_facet=database_name\">https://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-visible-internal-db&amp;ref=1.0a17#/_internal/catalog_columns?_facet=database_name</a></code></p>\n<p>To explain what's going on here, let's first review the individual components.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/url-addressable-python/#datasette-lite\">Datasette Lite</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/url-addressable-python/#the-datasette-1-0-alphas\">The Datasette 1.0 alphas</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/url-addressable-python/#this-works-for-plugins-too\">This works for plugins, too</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/url-addressable-python/#datasette-visible-internal-db\">datasette-visible-internal-db</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/url-addressable-python/#spotting-the-bug\">Spotting the bug</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/url-addressable-python/#fixing-the-bug\">Fixing the bug</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/url-addressable-python/#url-addressable-steps-to-reproduce\">URL-addressable Steps To Reproduce</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"datasette-lite\">Datasette Lite</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://lite.datasette.io/\">Datasette Lite</a> is a version of <a href=\"https://datasette.io/\">Datasette</a> that runs entirely in your browser. It runs on <a href=\"https://pyodide.org/\">Pyodide</a>, which I think is still the most underappreciated project in the Python ecosystem.</p>\n<p>I built Datasette Lite <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2022/May/4/datasette-lite/\">almost three years ago</a> as a weekend hack project to try and see if I could get Datasette - a server-side Python web application - to run entirely in the browser.</p>\n<p>I've added a bunch of features since then, <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite/blob/main/README.md\">described in the README</a> - most significantly the ability to load SQLite databases, CSV files, JSON files or Parquet files by passing a URL to a query string parameter.</p>\n<p>I built Datasette Lite almost as a joke, thinking nobody would want to wait for a full Python interpreter to download to their browser each time they wanted to explore some data. It turns out internet connections are fast these days and having a version of Datasette that needs a browser, GitHub Pages and <em>nothing else</em> is actually extremely useful.</p>\n<p>Just the other day <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/obtusatum.bsky.social/post/3lhyeuqmpns22\">I saw Logan Williams</a> of Bellingcat using it to share a better version of <a href=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/2/cruz-led-investigation-uncovers-2-billion-in-woke-dei-grants-at-nsf-releases-full-database\">this Excel sheet</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The NSF grants that Ted Cruz has singled out for advancing \"neo-Marxist class warfare propaganda,\" in Datasette-Lite: <a href=\"https://lite.datasette.io/?url=https://data-house-lake.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/cruz_nhs.db#/cruz_nhs/grants\">lite.datasette.io?url=https://...</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's look at that URL in full:</p>\n<p><code>https://lite.datasette.io/?url=https://data-house-lake.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/cruz_nhs.db#/cruz_nhs/grants</code></p>\n<p>The <code>?url=</code> parameter there poins to a SQLite database file, hosted on DigitalOcean Spaces and served with the all-important <code>access-control-allow-origin: *</code> header which allows Datasette Lite to load it across domains.</p>\n<p>The <code>#/cruz_nhs/grants</code> part of the URL tells Datasette Lite which page to load when you visit the link.</p>\n<p>Anything after the <code>#</code> in Datasette Lite is a URL that gets passed on to the WebAssembly-hosted Datasette instance. Any query string items before that can be used to affect the initial state of the Datasette instance, to import data or even to install additional plugins.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-datasette-1-0-alphas\">The Datasette 1.0 alphas</h4>\n\n<p>I've shipped <em>a lot</em> of Datasette alphas - the most recent is <a href=\"https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#a17-2025-02-06\">Datasette 1.0a17</a>. Those alphas get published to <a href=\"https://pypi.org/\">PyPI</a>, which means they can be installed using <code>pip install datasette==1.0a17</code>.</p>\n<p>A while back <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite/issues/75\">I added the same ability</a> to Datasette Lite itself. You can now pass <code>&amp;ref=1.0a17</code> to the Datasette Lite URL to load that specific version of Datasette.</p>\n<p>This works thanks to the magic of Pyodide's <a href=\"https://micropip.pyodide.org/\">micropip</a> mechanism. Every time you load Datasette Lite in your browser it's actually using <code>micropip</code> to install the packages it needs directly from PyPI. The code looks something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">await</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">pyodide</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">loadPackage</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">'micropip'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">messageCallback</span>: <span class=\"pl-s1\">log</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">let</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">datasetteToInstall</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">'datasette'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">let</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">pre</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">'False'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">if</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">settings</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">ref</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-k\">if</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">settings</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">ref</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">==</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">'pre'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-s1\">pre</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">'True'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">else</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-s1\">datasetteToInstall</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">`datasette==<span class=\"pl-s1\"><span class=\"pl-kos\">${</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">settings</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">ref</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></span>`</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span>\n<span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">await</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">self</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">pyodide</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">runPythonAsync</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">`</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">import micropip</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">await micropip.install(\"<span class=\"pl-s1\"><span class=\"pl-kos\">${</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">datasetteToInstall</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></span>\", pre=<span class=\"pl-s1\"><span class=\"pl-kos\">${</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">pre</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></span>)</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">`</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span></pre></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite/blob/main/webworker.js\">Full code here</a>.</p>\n<p>That <code>settings</code> object has been passed to the Web Worker that loads Datasette, incorporating various query string parameters.</p>\n<p>This all means I can pass <code>?ref=1.0a17</code> to Datasette Lite to load a specific version, or <code>?ref=pre</code> to get the most recently released pre-release version.</p>\n<h4 id=\"this-works-for-plugins-too\">This works for plugins, too</h4>\n<p>Since loading extra packages from PyPI via <code>micropip</code> is so easy, I went a step further and added plugin support.</p>\n<p>The <code>?install=</code> parameter can be passed multiple times, each time specifying a Datasette plugin from PyPI that should be installed into the browser.</p>\n<p>The README includes <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-plugins\">a bunch of examples</a> of this mechanism in action. Here's a fun one <a href=\"https://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-mp3-audio&amp;csv=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/0a30d52feeb3ff60f7d8636b0bde296b/raw/c078a9e5a0151331e2e46c04c1ebe7edc9f45e8c/scotrail-announcements.csv#/data/scotrail-announcements\">that loads datasette-mp3-audio</a> to provide inline MP3 playing widgets, originally created for my <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2022/Aug/21/scotrail/\">ScotRail audio announcements</a> project.</p>\n<p>This only works for some plugins. They need to be pure Python wheels - getting plugins with compiled binary dependencies to work in Pyodide WebAssembly requires a whole set of steps that I haven't quite figured out.</p>\n<p>Frustratingly, it doesn't work for plugins that run their own JavaScript yet! I may need to rearchitect significant chunks of both Datasette and Datasette Lite to make that work.</p>\n<p>It's also worth noting that this is a remote code execution security hole. I don't think that's a problem here, because <code>lite.datasette.io</code> is deliberately hosted on the subdomain of a domain that I <em>never</em> intend to use cookies on. It's possible to vandalize the visual display of <code>lite.datasette.io</code> but it shouldn't be possible to steal any private data or do any lasting damage.</p>\n<h4 id=\"datasette-visible-internal-db\">datasette-visible-internal-db</h4>\n<p>This evening's debugging exercise used a plugin called <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/datasette-visible-internal-db/\">datasette-visible-internal-db</a>.</p>\n<p>Datasette's <a href=\"https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/internals.html#datasette-s-internal-database\">internal database</a> is an invisible SQLite database that sits at the heart of Datasette, tracking things like loaded metadata and the schemas of the currently attached tables.</p>\n<p>Being invisible means we can use it for features that shouldn't be visible to users - plugins that record API secrets or permissions or track comments or data import progress, for example.</p>\n<p>In Python code it's accessed like this:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"pl-s1\">internal_db</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">datasette</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">get_internal_database</span>()</pre>\n<p>As opposed to Datasette's other databases which are accessed like so:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"pl-s1\">db</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">datasette</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">get_database</span>(<span class=\"pl-s\">\"my-database\"</span>)</pre>\n<p>Sometimes, when hacking on Datasette, it's useful to be able to browse the internal database using the default Datasette UI.</p>\n<p>That's what <code>datasette-visible-internal-db</code> does. The plugin implementation is <a href=\"https://github.com/datasette/datasette-visible-internal-db/blob/759e7001f91d3076d9f42eddb03fbaf6d1c7b9bb/datasette_visible_internal_db.py\">just five lines of code</a>:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"pl-k\">import</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">datasette</span>\n\n<span class=\"pl-en\">@<span class=\"pl-s1\">datasette</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">hookimpl</span></span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">def</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">startup</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">datasette</span>):\n    <span class=\"pl-s1\">db</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">datasette</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">get_internal_database</span>()\n    <span class=\"pl-s1\">datasette</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">add_database</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">db</span>, <span class=\"pl-s1\">name</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\"_internal\"</span>, <span class=\"pl-s1\">route</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\"_internal\"</span>)</pre>\n<p>On startup the plugin grabs a reference to that internal database and then registers it using Datasette's <a href=\"https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/internals.html#add-database-db-name-none-route-none\">add_database() method</a>. That's all it takes to have it show up as a visible database on the <code>/_internal</code> path within Datasette.</p>\n<h4 id=\"spotting-the-bug\">Spotting the bug</h4>\n<p>I was poking around with this today out of pure curiosity - I hadn't tried <code>?install=datasette-visible-internal-db</code> with Datasette Lite before and I wanted to see if it worked.</p>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-visible-internal-db&amp;ref=1.0a17#/_internal/catalog_columns?_facet=database_name\">that URL from earlier</a>, this time with commentary:</p>\n<pre><code>https://lite.datasette.io/ // Datasette Lite\n  ?install=datasette-visible-internal-db // Install the visible internal DB plugin\n  &amp;ref=1.0a17 // Load the 1.0a17 alpha release\n  #/_internal/catalog_columns // Navigate to the /_internal/catalog_columns table page\n  &amp;_facet=database_name // Facet by database_name for good measure\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this is what I saw:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of Datasette Lite. catalog_columns table has 382 rows. database_name facet shows content 237, fixtures 97, _internal 48. A table shows columns for Link, database_name, table_name, cid and name - a red arrow points to a hyperlinked _internal in the database_name column.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/datasette-lite-bug.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>This all looked good... until I clicked on that <code>_internal</code> link in the <code>database_name</code> column... and it took me to <a href=\"https://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-visible-internal-db&amp;ref=1.0a17#/_internal/databases/_internal\">this /_internal/databases/_internal 404 page</a>.</p>\n<p>Why was that a 404? Datasette introspects the SQLite table schema to identify foreign key relationships, then turns those into hyperlinks. The SQL schema for that <code>catalog_columns</code> table (displayed at the bottom of the table page) looked like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-sql\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">CREATE</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">TABLE</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">catalog_columns</span> (\n    database_name <span class=\"pl-k\">TEXT</span>,\n    table_name <span class=\"pl-k\">TEXT</span>,\n    cid <span class=\"pl-k\">INTEGER</span>,\n    name <span class=\"pl-k\">TEXT</span>,\n    type <span class=\"pl-k\">TEXT</span>,\n    <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>notnull<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"pl-k\">INTEGER</span>,\n    default_value <span class=\"pl-k\">TEXT</span>, <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">--</span> renamed from dflt_value</span>\n    is_pk <span class=\"pl-k\">INTEGER</span>, <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">--</span> renamed from pk</span>\n    hidden <span class=\"pl-k\">INTEGER</span>,\n    <span class=\"pl-k\">PRIMARY KEY</span> (database_name, table_name, name),\n    <span class=\"pl-k\">FOREIGN KEY</span> (database_name) <span class=\"pl-k\">REFERENCES</span> databases(database_name),\n    <span class=\"pl-k\">FOREIGN KEY</span> (database_name, table_name) <span class=\"pl-k\">REFERENCES</span> tables(database_name, table_name)\n);</pre></div>\n<p>Those foreign key references are a bug! I renamed the internal tables from <code>databases</code> and <code>tables</code> to <code>catalog_databases</code> and <code>catalog_tables</code> quite a while ago, but apparently forgot to update the references - and SQLite let me get away with it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"fixing-the-bug\">Fixing the bug</h4>\n<p>I fixed the bug <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/e59fd0175708f2b14d4e3c08ea16631bda0aaed3\">in this commit</a>. As is often the case the most interesting part of the fix is <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/e59fd0175708f2b14d4e3c08ea16631bda0aaed3/tests/test_internal_db.py#L65-L84\">the accompanying test</a>.

That code can then use the blocking <code>sqlite-utils</code> <a href=\"https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#introspecting-tables-and-views\">introspection methods</a> - here I'm looping through every table in that internal database, looping through each tables <code>.foreign_keys</code> and confirming that the <code>.other_table</code> and <code>.other_column</code> values reference a table and column that genuinely exist.</p>\n<p>I ran this test, watched it fail, then applied the fix and it passed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"url-addressable-steps-to-reproduce\">URL-addressable Steps To Reproduce</h4>\n<p>The idea I most wanted to highlight here is the enormous value provided by <strong>URL-addressable Steps To Reproduce</strong>.</p>\n<p>Having good Steps To Reproduce is crucial for productively fixing bugs. Something you can <em>click on</em> to see the bug is the most effective form of STR there is.</p>\n<p>Ideally, these URLs will continue to work long into the future.</p>\n<p>The great thing about a system like Datasette Lite is that everything is statically hosted files. The application itself is hosted on GitHub Pages, and it works by loading additional files from various different CDNs. The only dynamic aspect is cached lookups against the PyPI API, which I expect to stay stable for a long time to come.</p>\n<p>As a stable component of the Web platform <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/wasm\">for almost 8 years</a> WebAssembly is clearly here to stay. I expect we'll be able to execute today's WASM code in browsers 20+ years from now.</p>\n<p>I'm confident that the patterns I've been exploring in Datasette Lite over the past few years could be just as valuable for other projects. Imagine demonstrating bugs in a Django application using a static WebAssembly build, archived forever as part of an issue tracking system.</p>\n<p>I think WebAssembly and Pyodide still have a great deal of untapped potential for the wider Python world.</p>",

I figure it's a good opportunity to highlight how useful it is to have a URL-addressable Python environment, powered by Pyodide and WebAssembly.</p>\n<p>Here's the page that helped me discover the bug:</p>\n<p><code><a href=\"https://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-visible-internal-db&amp;ref=1.0a17#/_internal/catalog_columns?_facet=database_name\">https://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-visible-internal-db&amp;ref=1.0a17#/_internal/catalog_columns?_facet=database_name</a></code></p>\n<p>To explain what's going on here, let's first review the individual components.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/url-addressable-python/#datasette-lite\">Datasette Lite</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/url-addressable-python/#the-datasette-1-0-alphas\">The Datasette 1.0 alphas</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/url-addressable-python/#this-works-for-plugins-too\">This works for plugins, too</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/url-addressable-python/#datasette-visible-internal-db\">datasette-visible-internal-db</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/url-addressable-python/#spotting-the-bug\">Spotting the bug</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/url-addressable-python/#fixing-the-bug\">Fixing the bug</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/url-addressable-python/#url-addressable-steps-to-reproduce\">URL-addressable Steps To Reproduce</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"datasette-lite\">Datasette Lite</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://lite.datasette.io/\">Datasette Lite</a> is a version of <a href=\"https://datasette.io/\">Datasette</a> that runs entirely in your browser. It runs on <a href=\"https://pyodide.org/\">Pyodide</a>, which I think is still the most underappreciated project in the Python ecosystem.</p>\n<p>I built Datasette Lite <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2022/May/4/datasette-lite/\">almost three years ago</a> as a weekend hack project to try and see if I could get Datasette - a server-side Python web application - to run entirely in the browser.</p>\n<p>I've added a bunch of features since then, <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite/blob/main/README.md\">described in the README</a> - most significantly the ability to load SQLite databases, CSV files, JSON files or Parquet files by passing a URL to a query string parameter.</p>\n<p>I built Datasette Lite almost as a joke, thinking nobody would want to wait for a full Python interpreter to download to their browser each time they wanted to explore some data. It turns out internet connections are fast these days and having a version of Datasette that needs a browser, GitHub Pages and <em>nothing else</em> is actually extremely useful.</p>\n<p>Just the other day <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/obtusatum.bsky.social/post/3lhyeuqmpns22\">I saw Logan Williams</a> of Bellingcat using it to share a better version of <a href=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/2/cruz-led-investigation-uncovers-2-billion-in-woke-dei-grants-at-nsf-releases-full-database\">this Excel sheet</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The NSF grants that Ted Cruz has singled out for advancing \"neo-Marxist class warfare propaganda,\" in Datasette-Lite: <a href=\"https://lite.datasette.io/?url=https://data-house-lake.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/cruz_nhs.db#/cruz_nhs/grants\">lite.datasette.io?url=https://...</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's look at that URL in full:</p>\n<p><code>https://lite.datasette.io/?url=https://data-house-lake.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/cruz_nhs.db#/cruz_nhs/grants</code></p>\n<p>The <code>?url=</code> parameter there poins to a SQLite database file, hosted on DigitalOcean Spaces and served with the all-important <code>access-control-allow-origin: *</code> header which allows Datasette Lite to load it across domains.</p>\n<p>The <code>#/cruz_nhs/grants</code> part of the URL tells Datasette Lite which page to load when you visit the link.</p>\n<p>Anything after the <code>#</code> in Datasette Lite is a URL that gets passed on to the WebAssembly-hosted Datasette instance. Any query string items before that can be used to affect the initial state of the Datasette instance, to import data or even to install additional plugins.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-datasette-1-0-alphas\">The Datasette 1.0 alphas</h4>\n\n<p>I've shipped <em>a lot</em> of Datasette alphas - the most recent is <a href=\"https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#a17-2025-02-06\">Datasette 1.0a17</a>. Those alphas get published to <a href=\"https://pypi.org/\">PyPI</a>, which means they can be installed using <code>pip install datasette==1.0a17</code>.</p>\n<p>A while back <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite/issues/75\">I added the same ability</a> to Datasette Lite itself. You can now pass <code>&amp;ref=1.0a17</code> to the Datasette Lite URL to load that specific version of Datasette.</p>\n<p>This works thanks to the magic of Pyodide's <a href=\"https://micropip.pyodide.org/\">micropip</a> mechanism. Every time you load Datasette Lite in your browser it's actually using <code>micropip</code> to install the packages it needs directly from PyPI. The code looks something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">await</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">pyodide</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">loadPackage</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">'micropip'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">messageCallback</span>: <span class=\"pl-s1\">log</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">let</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">datasetteToInstall</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">'datasette'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">let</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">pre</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">'False'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">if</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">settings</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">ref</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-k\">if</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">settings</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">ref</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">==</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">'pre'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-s1\">pre</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">'True'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">else</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-s1\">datasetteToInstall</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">`datasette==<span class=\"pl-s1\"><span class=\"pl-kos\">${</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">settings</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">ref</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></span>`</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span>\n<span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">await</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">self</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">pyodide</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">runPythonAsync</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">`</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">import micropip</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">await micropip.install(\"<span class=\"pl-s1\"><span class=\"pl-kos\">${</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">datasetteToInstall</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></span>\", pre=<span class=\"pl-s1\"><span class=\"pl-kos\">${</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">pre</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></span>)</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">`</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span></pre></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite/blob/main/webworker.js\">Full code here</a>.</p>\n<p>That <code>settings</code> object has been passed to the Web Worker that loads Datasette, incorporating various query string parameters.</p>\n<p>This all means I can pass <code>?ref=1.0a17</code> to Datasette Lite to load a specific version, or <code>?ref=pre</code> to get the most recently released pre-release version.</p>\n<h4 id=\"this-works-for-plugins-too\">This works for plugins, too</h4>\n<p>Since loading extra packages from PyPI via <code>micropip</code> is so easy, I went a step further and added plugin support.</p>\n<p>The <code>?install=</code> parameter can be passed multiple times, each time specifying a Datasette plugin from PyPI that should be installed into the browser.</p>\n<p>The README includes <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-plugins\">a bunch of examples</a> of this mechanism in action. Here's a fun one <a href=\"https://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-mp3-audio&amp;csv=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/0a30d52feeb3ff60f7d8636b0bde296b/raw/c078a9e5a0151331e2e46c04c1ebe7edc9f45e8c/scotrail-announcements.csv#/data/scotrail-announcements\">that loads datasette-mp3-audio</a> to provide inline MP3 playing widgets, originally created for my <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2022/Aug/21/scotrail/\">ScotRail audio announcements</a> project.</p>\n<p>This only works for some plugins. They need to be pure Python wheels - getting plugins with compiled binary dependencies to work in Pyodide WebAssembly requires a whole set of steps that I haven't quite figured out.</p>\n<p>Frustratingly, it doesn't work for plugins that run their own JavaScript yet! I may need to rearchitect significant chunks of both Datasette and Datasette Lite to make that work.</p>\n<p>It's also worth noting that this is a remote code execution security hole. I don't think that's a problem here, because <code>lite.datasette.io</code> is deliberately hosted on the subdomain of a domain that I <em>never</em> intend to use cookies on. It's possible to vandalize the visual display of <code>lite.datasette.io</code> but it shouldn't be possible to steal any private data or do any lasting damage.</p>\n<h4 id=\"datasette-visible-internal-db\">datasette-visible-internal-db</h4>\n<p>This evening's debugging exercise used a plugin called <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/datasette-visible-internal-db/\">datasette-visible-internal-db</a>.</p>\n<p>Datasette's <a href=\"https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/internals.html#datasette-s-internal-database\">internal database</a> is an invisible SQLite database that sits at the heart of Datasette, tracking things like loaded metadata and the schemas of the currently attached tables.</p>\n<p>Being invisible means we can use it for features that shouldn't be visible to users - plugins that record API secrets or permissions or track comments or data import progress, for example.</p>\n<p>In Python code it's accessed like this:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"pl-s1\">internal_db</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">datasette</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">get_internal_database</span>()</pre>\n<p>As opposed to Datasette's other databases which are accessed like so:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"pl-s1\">db</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">datasette</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">get_database</span>(<span class=\"pl-s\">\"my-database\"</span>)</pre>\n<p>Sometimes, when hacking on Datasette, it's useful to be able to browse the internal database using the default Datasette UI.</p>\n<p>That's what <code>datasette-visible-internal-db</code> does. The plugin implementation is <a href=\"https://github.com/datasette/datasette-visible-internal-db/blob/759e7001f91d3076d9f42eddb03fbaf6d1c7b9bb/datasette_visible_internal_db.py\">just five lines of code</a>:</p>\n<pre><span class=\"pl-k\">import</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">datasette</span>\n\n<span class=\"pl-en\">@<span class=\"pl-s1\">datasette</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">hookimpl</span></span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">def</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">startup</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">datasette</span>):\n    <span class=\"pl-s1\">db</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">datasette</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">get_internal_database</span>()\n    <span class=\"pl-s1\">datasette</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">add_database</span>(<span class=\"pl-s1\">db</span>, <span class=\"pl-s1\">name</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\"_internal\"</span>, <span class=\"pl-s1\">route</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\"_internal\"</span>)</pre>\n<p>On startup the plugin grabs a reference to that internal database and then registers it using Datasette's <a href=\"https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/internals.html#add-database-db-name-none-route-none\">add_database() method</a>. That's all it takes to have it show up as a visible database on the <code>/_internal</code> path within Datasette.</p>\n<h4 id=\"spotting-the-bug\">Spotting the bug</h4>\n<p>I was poking around with this today out of pure curiosity - I hadn't tried <code>?install=datasette-visible-internal-db</code> with Datasette Lite before and I wanted to see if it worked.</p>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-visible-internal-db&amp;ref=1.0a17#/_internal/catalog_columns?_facet=database_name\">that URL from earlier</a>, this time with commentary:</p>\n<pre><code>https://lite.datasette.io/ // Datasette Lite\n  ?install=datasette-visible-internal-db // Install the visible internal DB plugin\n  &amp;ref=1.0a17 // Load the 1.0a17 alpha release\n  #/_internal/catalog_columns // Navigate to the /_internal/catalog_columns table page\n  &amp;_facet=database_name // Facet by database_name for good measure\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this is what I saw:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of Datasette Lite. catalog_columns table has 382 rows. database_name facet shows content 237, fixtures 97, _internal 48. A table shows columns for Link, database_name, table_name, cid and name - a red arrow points to a hyperlinked _internal in the database_name column.\" src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/datasette-lite-bug.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>This all looked good... until I clicked on that <code>_internal</code> link in the <code>database_name</code> column... and it took me to <a href=\"https://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-visible-internal-db&amp;ref=1.0a17#/_internal/databases/_internal\">this /_internal/databases/_internal 404 page</a>.</p>\n<p>Why was that a 404? Datasette introspects the SQLite table schema to identify foreign key relationships, then turns those into hyperlinks. The SQL schema for that <code>catalog_columns</code> table (displayed at the bottom of the table page) looked like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-sql\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">CREATE</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">TABLE</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">catalog_columns</span> (\n    database_name <span class=\"pl-k\">TEXT</span>,\n    table_name <span class=\"pl-k\">TEXT</span>,\n    cid <span class=\"pl-k\">INTEGER</span>,\n    name <span class=\"pl-k\">TEXT</span>,\n    type <span class=\"pl-k\">TEXT</span>,\n    <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>notnull<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"pl-k\">INTEGER</span>,\n    default_value <span class=\"pl-k\">TEXT</span>, <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">--</span> renamed from dflt_value</span>\n    is_pk <span class=\"pl-k\">INTEGER</span>, <span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">--</span> renamed from pk</span>\n    hidden <span class=\"pl-k\">INTEGER</span>,\n    <span class=\"pl-k\">PRIMARY KEY</span> (database_name, table_name, name),\n    <span class=\"pl-k\">FOREIGN KEY</span> (database_name) <span class=\"pl-k\">REFERENCES</span> databases(database_name),\n    <span class=\"pl-k\">FOREIGN KEY</span> (database_name, table_name) <span class=\"pl-k\">REFERENCES</span> tables(database_name, table_name)\n);</pre></div>\n<p>Those foreign key references are a bug! I renamed the internal tables from <code>databases</code> and <code>tables</code> to <code>catalog_databases</code> and <code>catalog_tables</code> quite a while ago, but apparently forgot to update the references - and SQLite let me get away with it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"fixing-the-bug\">Fixing the bug</h4>\n<p>I fixed the bug <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/e59fd0175708f2b14d4e3c08ea16631bda0aaed3\">in this commit</a>.

That code can then use the blocking <code>sqlite-utils</code> <a href=\"https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#introspecting-tables-and-views\">introspection methods</a> - here I'm looping through every table in that internal database, looping through each tables <code>.foreign_keys</code> and confirming that the <code>.other_table</code> and <code>.other_column</code> values reference a table and column that genuinely exist.</p>\n<p>I ran this test, watched it fail, then applied the fix and it passed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"url-addressable-steps-to-reproduce\">URL-addressable Steps To Reproduce</h4>\n<p>The idea I most wanted to highlight here is the enormous value provided by <strong>URL-addressable Steps To Reproduce</strong>.</p>\n<p>Having good Steps To Reproduce is crucial for productively fixing bugs. Something you can <em>click on</em> to see the bug is the most effective form of STR there is.</p>\n<p>Ideally, these URLs will continue to work long into the future.</p>\n<p>The great thing about a system like Datasette Lite is that everything is statically hosted files. The application itself is hosted on GitHub Pages, and it works by loading additional files from various different CDNs. The only dynamic aspect is cached lookups against the PyPI API, which I expect to stay stable for a long time to come.</p>\n<p>As a stable component of the Web platform <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/wasm\">for almost 8 years</a> WebAssembly is clearly here to stay. I expect we'll be able to execute today's WASM code in browsers 20+ years from now.</p>\n<p>I'm confident that the patterns I've been exploring in Datasette Lite over the past few years could be just as valuable for other projects. Imagine demonstrating bugs in a Django application using a static WebAssembly build, archived forever as part of an issue tracking system.</p>\n<p>I think WebAssembly and Pyodide still have a great deal of untapped potential for the wider Python world.</p>"

I started with my <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-plugin\">simonw/llm-plugin</a> cookiecutter template:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>uvx cookiecutter gh:simonw/llm-plugin</pre></div>\n<pre><code>  [1/6] plugin_name (): smollm2\n  [2/6] description (): SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1 for LLM\n  [3/6] hyphenated (smollm2): \n  [4/6] underscored (smollm2): \n  [5/6] github_username (): simonw\n  [6/6] author_name (): Simon Willison\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-smollm2/blob/0.1.1/llm_smollm2/__init__.py\">rest of the plugin</a> was mostly borrowed from my existing <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-gguf/blob/0.2/llm_gguf.py\">llm-gguf</a> plugin, updated based on the latest README for the <code>llama-cpp-python</code> project.</p>\n<p>There's more information on building plugins in <a href=\"https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/tutorial-model-plugin.html\">the tutorial on writing a plugin</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"packaging-the-plugin\">Packaging the plugin</h4>\n<p>Once I had that working the last step was to figure out how to package it for PyPI. I'm never quite sure of the best way to bundle a binary file in a Python package, especially one that uses a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file... so I dumped a copy of my existing <code>pyproject.toml</code> file into o3-mini-high and prompted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Modify this to bundle a SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1.gguf file inside the package. I don't want to use hatch or a manifest or anything, I just want to use setuptools.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/67a59122-67c8-8006-9be4-29f8419343ad\">the shared transcript</a> - it gave me exactly what I wanted. I bundled it by adding this to the end of the <code>toml</code> file:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-toml\"><pre>[<span class=\"pl-en\">tool</span>.<span class=\"pl-en\">setuptools</span>.<span class=\"pl-en\">package-data</span>]\n<span class=\"pl-smi\">llm_smollm2</span> = [<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1.gguf<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>]</pre></div>\n<p>Then dropping that <code>.gguf</code> file into the <code>llm_smollm2/</code> directory and putting my plugin code in <code>llm_smollm2/__init__.py</code>.</p>\n<p>I tested it locally by running this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>python -m pip install build\npython -m build</pre></div>\n<p>I fired up a fresh virtual environment and ran <code>pip install ../path/to/llm-smollm2/dist/llm_smollm2-0.1-py3-none-any.whl</code> to confirm that the package worked as expected.</p>\n<h4 id=\"publishing-to-pypi\">Publishing to PyPI</h4>\n<p>My cookiecutter template comes with <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-smollm2/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml\">a GitHub Actions workflow</a> that publishes the package to PyPI when a new release is created using the GitHub web interface.

It's not really surprising but it turns out 94MB really isn't enough space for a model that can do anything useful.</p>\n<p>It's <em>super</em> fun to play with, and I continue to maintain that small, weak models are a great way to help build a mental model of how this technology actually works.</p>\n<p>That's not to say SmolLM2 isn't a fantastic model family.

I'm never quite sure of the best way to bundle a binary file in a Python package, especially one that uses a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file... so I dumped a copy of my existing <code>pyproject.toml</code> file into o3-mini-high and prompted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Modify this to bundle a SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1.gguf file inside the package. I don't want to use hatch or a manifest or anything, I just want to use setuptools.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/67a59122-67c8-8006-9be4-29f8419343ad\">the shared transcript</a> - it gave me exactly what I wanted. I bundled it by adding this to the end of the <code>toml</code> file:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-toml\"><pre>[<span class=\"pl-en\">tool</span>.<span class=\"pl-en\">setuptools</span>.<span class=\"pl-en\">package-data</span>]\n<span class=\"pl-smi\">llm_smollm2</span> = [<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1.gguf<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>]</pre></div>\n<p>Then dropping that <code>.gguf</code> file into the <code>llm_smollm2/</code> directory and putting my plugin code in <code>llm_smollm2/__init__.py</code>.</p>\n<p>I tested it locally by running this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>python -m pip install build\npython -m build</pre></div>\n<p>I fired up a fresh virtual environment and ran <code>pip install ../path/to/llm-smollm2/dist/llm_smollm2-0.1-py3-none-any.whl</code> to confirm that the package worked as expected.</p>\n<h4 id=\"publishing-to-pypi\">Publishing to PyPI</h4>\n<p>My cookiecutter template comes with <a href=\"https://github.com/simonw/llm-smollm2/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml\">a GitHub Actions workflow</a> that publishes the package to PyPI when a new release is created using the GitHub web interface.
